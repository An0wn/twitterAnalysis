17145858,@joeymcintyre I am addicted to Wild Cherry Pepsi, i keep trying to quit... I'm weak and never last long!

17145858,Just got an A on my A&P quiz! :) Only missed 1!
17145858,HMMM wonder if it would be too much to ask to have hubby bring me my laptop charger I forgot at home :(
17145858,At school on my day off, need some peace and quiet to study... With wifi so hitting the library!

17145858,My day was draining... tomorrow will be my Study day! Lots to get accomplished!
17145858,@DeborahGibson LOL I have someone my phone likes to call as well.... not nearly as interesting as Tiffany though!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy This morning! I RT'd something yesterday, so that may be why!
17145858,@sarah_janes Still trying to take this all in, I am so careful, i dunno how I missed this one! :p
17145858,@sarah_janes thanks for the reminder! According to the shunt manufacture the magnet has to get within 6 inches of the valve!
17145858,I don't wanna brag but @rachaelrayshow is following me... I'm a little excited about that, I LOVE her!
17145858,Oh and have I mentioned lately that #hydrosucks!
17145858,Working on putting a blog post together about Magnets! :) May seem silly but it could be life saving to someone with a programmable shunt!
17145858,@allyeigh me too, and it's such a simple fix :)
17145858,@allyeigh Apparently those big headphones (like they use at school) have magnets in them. His shunt his magnetic, so they cause it to reset!
17145858,Tristan's shunt needed to be reset, after trying to figure out why it keeps resetting itself, we may have found the cause - headphones!
17145858,Scan done waiting to see PA now... Its been a long day!
17145858,At the hospital waiting for Tristan's scan!
17145858,@krisfitz7 LOL I tweeted before NK did! Besides you people tweet a lot! ha ha
17145858,I have arrived at school... Good times!
17145858,It's not personal... if it was id unfollow, block and unlist! :)
17145858,NK fans I usually unfollow because they tweet the guys A LOT and it fills up my home page causing me to miss tweets from others
17145858,Note... Just because I unfollow you does not mean I do not like you... I still have you in my lists
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg I will not be lurkin late! Have a fab evening, and watch out for @JonathanRKnight's balls! :p
17145858,@JKnDdubAngel HMMM I can so relate to that tweet!

17145858,@mandisaofficial I can't imagine keeping quiet, I felt so bad when I heard that story!
17145858,@jquesmith Only if I work out a lot and watch every bite that goes in my mouth! I was blessed with "big" genes.... :P
17145858,@mandisaofficial really? I had no idea, that must be torture! I did hear one of the contestants got booted because his dad bragged! Poor Guy
17145858,@jquesmith Roma's Pizza... I'm a simple girl who would rather be fat and happy, than skinny and hungry!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy True I am just saying there is no reason to not review something if you paid for it, id trust the opinion more in that case
17145858,@JonathanRKnight Cookie Monster?? ;)
17145858,I tweeted about needing to go to the Bathroom earlier and got reminded to wash my hands by @toiletbot totally made me LOL
17145858,I totally do not understand why blkberry designed this curve to blink its LED when the batt is low... defeats the purpose of reserving power
17145858,@WheelchairMommy I think a review is more reliable from someone who paid for something, than one from someone who got it for free!

17145858,@JKnDdubAngel I searched every nook and cranny they could fit one into... more than once! Shocked I have not checked again today LOL
17145858,Good Question!!! RT @JenLefler: why does @nkotb have to add more shows in same cities instead of new cities?!?
17145858,No more anatomy for now, im feeling cruddy again! :(
17145858,@ratties UMMM It's Lincoln's b-day Lots of schools out or half days!
17145858,OK enough annoying my followers... at least the non NK fan ones :) Time for some Anatomy!
17145858,@jordanknight I'd ask ya to get me, but that would assume you see this in the sea of tweets!
17145858,@RocksicleLover why would the 3rd show get canceled?
17145858,@krisfitz7 I have a NK name, I think you are following that one! :) But I never take the time to log onto it unless Im really bored!

17145858,@LoriB73 Crap! I was really hoping you were the lucky one!
17145858,@JenLefler Oh yuck! I hope it goes away quickly!
17145858,My 4yr old just sat a piece of candy in front of me and told me not to bite it.... man that was tough!
17145858,Wonders if @jordanknight was any good at Chemistry in High School?? Maybe he could tutor me ;)
17145858,Suggestions for a pair of decent in ear headphones, that don't cost a fortune??
17145858,@jordanknight No E! news for me (Don't have that channel)... please retweet the link when ya get it! :)
17145858,250 bucks for in ear headphones??? Seriously... Now now I know I paid no where near that!
17145858,@DAW69 Oh well... sheesh you'd think one of us would get lucky.... maybe itll be @lorib73!
17145858,@DAW69 Is the mail there yet??? :)
17145858,My dog chewed up my iPod headphones, looking for some new ones, and thinking "Did I really pay that much for mine" the answer is likely yes!
17145858,@dannywood Awww Your bubbletweets are the best! :)
17145858,@dannywood I already got an awesome Vday gift... My Coming Home DVD... I have a smart hubby! :) But Im not opposed to another...
17145858,@NKOTB The selling out of these shows should be a hint... we need a tour! ;) Seriously I just need you to come to STL, The Pageant is nice!
17145858,@Charla_v ick that would definitely cause a migraine for me! Of course these days everything triggers a migraine! LOL
17145858,@DAW69 Mine came via USPS... good ole postal service. Was in my mailbox!
17145858,@Charla_v at least with actual instruments they eventually start sounding pleasant... recorders never do!
17145858,@MoxieMel I asked him what song, he said none LOL I guess they are just practicing the different notes!
17145858,@ratties I say stay in bed :)
17145858,I have been listening to my son practice his recorder non stop for days... why must music instructors torture parents?!
17145858,Crap my 10,000th tweet was suppose to go to @jordanknight, instead it went to me drooling over Colby on Survivor! OOPS!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy I did not give away any details! :)
17145858,@TanyaLikesPink I am taking 5 classes, and decreasing my load would mean delaying entry into the nursing program :( it kind of sucks
17145858,I wonder if Colby tweets?! HMMM Must find out! - don't care if he wins, as long as he sticks around awhile! Haha #survivor
17145858,Tyson.... What on earth are you wearing?! LOL #survivor And my no is now a phew that was close!

17145858,@LoriB73 @MomofLoganElla I think a viewing party would be a blast!
17145858,@NicLNew Maybe yours is taking a lil longer because they needed to put the golden ticket in there?? ;)
17145858,@MomofLoganElla YAY!! Maybe they are shipping them state by state LOL
17145858,@LoriB73 Mine just changed in the last couple hours, hubby ordered 2/5, technically I am not supposed to know its coming, I need to confess!
17145858,Fulfilled... that is all...

17145858,@WheelchairMommy I have seen several people with several accounts to tweet 5 certain men. Some create accounts for each celeb they spam!

17145858,@NicLNew I noticed! RCMH is kind of small too isnt it? I don't mind small venues, and I am sure it is all business! Bigger venues cost more
17145858,@LoriB73 I think so too as well as Hope... Verizon was pretty much sold out last summer, i dunno how they could not come here!
17145858,Hello Migraine... so sweet of you to just pop up out of now where with no warning :P

17145858,Bonus of not being able to travel for @nkotb shows... No ticket buying drama to deal with! HA
17145858,Just got a 93% on my first A&P quiz... guess all that studying paid off :)
17145858,@Flergs wow! That is bold! Sorry people are ripping you off... That's worse than giving it to people free IMO
17145858,RT @Flergs: New Estranged Collection now available and buy the Collection or full kit to get a freebie!http://bit.ly/8cxr2Q
17145858,@Charla_v UGH Sophie used to be like that! Drove me nuts!

17145858,@LoriB73 Now that is something to look forward to as well!
17145858,I keep trying to remind myself there are several reasons why I am not in Chicago to see @joeymcintyre, still bummed to be missing out though
17145858,@MacsSTLsweetie Wasnt there a pre-show meet up?! Go get warm!!
17145858,Gotta go get the new tags for our plates... so not looking forward to this!

17145858,Being around all these kids is comical!
17145858,@seanalgaier I though Jillian was awesome! I so love her... Wish I could have her training me! LOL
17145858,Should have dressed warmer it is freezing out and the walk from the parking lot to class is awful!
17145858,Dear online course instructors, please open up assignments ahead of time, at least 1... I like working ahead, then if im sick, Im still good
17145858,@jordanknight Good Morning... I intend to grow more brain cells today... Off to class in a bit, weird being in college at 30 something :)
17145858,@sarah_janes I hate it too!.... thankfully it just looks nasty here... no crud yet!
17145858,@simplyshannon I am absolutely sure you will! :) Wish I could be there! LOL
17145858,@MacsSTLsweetie No tweeting and driving! Have a great time in Chicago!
17145858,@simplyshannon Have a fantabalous day! :)
17145858,Up and ready to face the world! School again today, but only for an hour!

17145858,Watching biggest loser.... I love Jillian!
17145858,2 the girls i asked help on finding a class today, who pointed me in the wrong direction when they KNEW I was in their class.. Karma is all!
17145858,Think I might smack someone! :p
17145858,Gonna have to dress warm.... Had to park out in thr middle of no where
17145858,On Campus today... good times!
17145858,RT @MSF_USA: http://twitpic.com/yq7gy At Carrefour hospital in #Haiti Doctors Without Borders surgical team did 90 (cont) http://tl.gd/499k9
17145858,Reading @msf_usa's tweets are making me frustrated... I wish I could do more, cannot wait till I am done with nursing school!
17145858,UMMM where was I when @jordanknight was doing all those bubbletweets? I should be sent to time out for being a bad Jordan girl!
17145858,@jordanknight She looks pissed LOL... no idea who snookie is though... this is a Jersey Shore thing right?
17145858,So far I am ahead of the game in my classes... let's hope I can keep that momentum up!
17145858,Dear children... QUIT screaming and driving each other nuts!!!
17145858,Stupid computer class... UMMM i think I know how to save a file... and don't need XP for that... Why do they make you take stupid classes!
17145858,@JonathanRKnight Awww we all love you, even if you cannot spell! :)
17145858,@SunshineODT I probably need to take that... but have not yet! Good Luck!
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg I hate it when you dont add spaces.. twitter does not break the line, and I cannot see the whole thing! LOL
17145858,I think its weird when people who tweet a lot just up and delete their pages without a word... #justsayin
17145858,@SunshineODT so what class did you have today? I had A&P :) Good times!
17145858,On my way home and starving!
17145858,First day of class and already looking at sheep brains!
17145858,@jordanknight Looking good as usual! :) Have a great evening, and enjoy yourself where ever you are!
17145858,Ok going to hang with my honey!
17145858,@jonathanrknight you should do an Official Facebook FAN Page... nothing personal, but then the fakes would have competition! :)
17145858,@MacsSTLsweetie Use a command like "Go Potty" every time... she will get the hang of it! Eventually she will go on command!
17145858,@MacsSTLsweetie Crate her... when you cannot be keeping a close eye on her, put her in it, other times take her out every 30mins
17145858,@JonathanRKnight I cannot wait to watch either... unfortunately I have to! LOL
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg I'd be honored if you followed me... I won't even spam your DM box :)
17145858,@joeymcintyre If there was a way... I would so be there!
17145858,@DAW69 Hi Anita... nice to see a tweet from you! Good Luck!
17145858,@JeffTimmons98 So wish I could be there... Hopefully lots of people will be tweeting so I can enjoy it through them!
17145858,@daxholt The Impact? :) Nice...

17145858,@MzMcLean Pretty sure he only reads my emails HAHA I never get his attention on here!
17145858,@joeymcintyre Any chance one of the video winners who could not make it, could get a follow as a consolation prize?? :)
17145858,@jordanknight HAHA that is funny! Did you tell him who you are? Or leave him guessin?
17145858,@Tabbicats I've already seen a couple! But no mass spammers yet at least!
17145858,Nk fans... make sure you read ALL the rules for the contest, only one entry, and your account must be public #amexnkotb
17145858,@insearchofnkotb According to the instructions, you are required to have your account set to public
17145858,So I wonder how many people did not fully read the instructions and will tweet it multiple times and be disqualified! HA!
17145858,Hi @americanexpress I want to meet NKOTB! My favorite song starts: I Know It's #AmexNKOTB
17145858,@MzMcLean True! And I could split hotel cost with someone since I'd get 2 tickets!
17145858,@MzMcLean I am afraid to enter... winning and not being able to go x2 would be heartbreaking :(
17145858,UMMM "I'm Waiting" is now my favorite @joeymcintyre song... I gotta see that live ASAP!
17145858,@joeymcintyre I am bummed I am missing out on these shows... But grateful I have twitter so I can be there in spirit! :)
17145858,@Jeffscuties I thought we had till 5pm? Not really fair to give so many a head start on voting!

17145858,@WheelchairMommy Definitely go and Meet Donnie if there is... tell him a crazy Blockhead from STL sent you! HAHA
17145858,@jordanknight Seeing everything down there has solidified my decision to strive to work for Doctors without Borders when I become a nurse!
17145858,@MzMcLean if we guess right is he gonna tell us?! LOL
17145858,@WheelchairMommy any chance there is a movie shooting in Austin?! Suspect a NK might be there haha!
17145858,Seriously?! Seems like Aid got there as quick as they could! RT @BreakingNews: Photographer witnesses corpses used (cont) http://tl.gd/3n24k
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg HMMMM Austin... Sounds kinf of like Boston :p
17145858,Tristan's play is about civil rights.... He goes to a school that is 99% white... HMMMM
17145858,Off to Tristan's Play... Good times, he is forbidding me from taking pics... He does not know me very well!
17145858,@tedstryker because I sleep when he is on... BUT what they are doing to him is crappy!
17145858,@Flergs Looks Gorgeous, Cannot wait to see the entire thing!
17145858,@JKnDdubAngel What class??
17145858,@WheelchairMommy Ill send it in a lil bit, trying to gather more professional info on it (I saw it on a forum posting)
17145858,@WheelchairMommy It is a surgery for those with neurogenic bladder due to Spina Bifida or SCI! If successful NO MORE catheters!
17145858,Astonished at science just read about the Xiao Procedure... It could honestly change Tristan's life!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy PS have you heard of the Xiao Procedure, I just read about it, and am in awe!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy If this was facebook I'd "Like" your tweet HAHA
17145858,@MacsSTLsweetie I wanna play bingo!
17145858,@jordanknight And just where are you going?? PS are you gonna goto the Joe Show??
17145858,@SherriEShepherd that DDub has a way with the ladies! :)
17145858,A different kind of giveaway by @thepioneerwoman http://bit.ly/57ykXN #haiti
17145858,UPS is not shipping for free to Haiti, their operations are shut down there - http://bit.ly/5DefUD
17145858,@GirlGoneHealthy I dunno if I want to know the nutrition facts on my fave food... I may never eat it again! HAHA
17145858,Twitter hoax spreads rumors of airlines' free flights to Haiti - http://bit.ly/6TCWNn #cnn
17145858,@dannywood You need to tweet more... #justsayin :)
17145858,@dannywood That's because we all love your love tips... even my hubby is a fan! (And he is a strict non-nkotb fan!)
17145858,@allyeigh She did a post about RR, that's what started all this being out and everyone discussing it http://nkotbsummer.blogspot.com/
17145858,@allyeigh Some bought Gold packages because those proceeds were to goto charity for a bit at one point... did you read KT's blog?
17145858,@allyeigh RR has collected money for a few supposed charities, in exchange for a donation a drawing w/prize was supposed to happen
17145858,@allyeigh I actually thought they were just running things poorly till that point... now I feel more like it's a big old scam
17145858,@allyeigh Yep that be it! The fact he is finding it simpler to reimburse charity money, rather than provide proof it went to charity...
17145858,I think I should have just let hubby drive himself to his buddies, and been without the car... I am so tired now :(
17145858,Came home and my dog acted like she had not seen me in months, kept throwing a fit till I laid down so she could lay down with me! LOL
17145858,I am up, all so I can drive hubby 5mins to his buddy's house so they can carpool to work!
17145858,@JKnDdubAngel Maybe we should combine the Marshmallow dropping of pants with #pantsontheground HAHA
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg Awww it is almost midnight... In Boston anyway!
17145858,Pat Robertson gives Christians a bad name, in tragedy we should come together and be compassionate, serving, like Jesus! NOT condemning!
17145858,And now the stomach bug has hit Kaitlyn... Oh joy!
17145858,@ratties LOL I was laughing at the britney spears guy... he cracked me up!
17145858,@ratties That video is awesome, the other one I saw was not as comprehensive! HAHA Sad I missed it!
17145858,@joeymcintyre Very tragic! My hearts and prayers go out to everyone effected by it!
17145858,@ratties I watched most of it, but had to head out and get kids for the last 30mins :)
17145858,@lancearmstrong they are horrifying! I have had to turn the news off and avoid it...All I can do is pray for them!
17145858,@irishgirl75 Thanks, I missed it and was wondering why everyone was talking about it!
17145858,@simplyshannon What ipod were you using before?
17145858,@jordanknight I must have missed that... Darn!
17145858,Making chocolate covered pretzels!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy It is strange, last week it would just say the town I was in.. Dunno why it went back to the numbers
17145858,@jordanknight The video was Hilarious, thanks for sharing!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy Might be longitude latitude, GPS nonsense... No idea LOL I know it changes all the time when I tweet from my phone
17145858,@WheelchairMommy You can text me too :P I get twitter everywhere... Location is defined by my Twitter App on my phone (Not sure how)
17145858,@WheelchairMommy It just all blends in together, so It never really seems like i live in just the town my house is in...did that make sense?
17145858,@JoeGrl_DdubTude My twitter slowed a lot when I quit following most BH on this account... It was kind of nice!
17145858,@WheelchairMommy I replied hehe... And my town is not that teeny... OK maybe the town I live in is, but the area is not! LOL
17145858,@WheelchairMommy Heading there now!
17145858,@jordanknight are you watching AI?! You should come tweet with us!
17145858,Awww they split them up :( #AI

17145858,I really hope this guy sucks!

17145858,Ok working on updating my blog... if you are a blogger DM or tweet me the link... mine is http://deenasuprema.wordpress.com
17145858,@MzMcLean It was awful, I would be seeing replies to people I follow, yet never saw their tweets!
17145858,@MzMcLean Probably along with the fact twitter was not showing me people's tweets that I follow normally :P
17145858,@MzMcLean I missed those tweets! LOL
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg Can we sing "Close to You" instead?! ;) hehe
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg secret acting location?! HMMM NK CIA is gonna find you, you know they will!!
17145858,@MzMcLean LOL I deleted my farm! I kept forgetting to harvest crops in time... also kept killing fish in fishville!
17145858,@MacsSTLsweetie Did you get the info about the pre party? @simplyshannon is putting it together!
17145858,Cops called to Speidi's house for possible kidnapping?! Any1 else excited that we may never hear from them again? http://tinyurl.com/ycswy2a
17145858,@MzMcLean I thought it was pretty funny, I took one down and she sniffed it, then was fine! :P Weird dog!
17145858,Here you go, someone explain it to me?! I put them up a couple days ago, she noticed them and started growling!  http://twitvid.com/F9D60
17145858,My dog keeps barking/growling at the pics of the kids on the wall!?
17145858,@jefftimmons98 I gotta say I am jealous! Wish I could be in LA.... Ill be freezing in the midwest instead LOL

17145858,@voverton You have missed a lot :)
17145858,All the kids are at school, Hubby is at work... That means quiet study time for me! :)
17145858,@jordanknight It's diet right? Bad habits are hard to break, I drink soda for breakfast too!
17145858,@JonathanRKnight Me and hubby honeymooned in Boston! Great City I cannot wait to go back, soon I hope! Its been almost 6yrs!
17145858,Hubby is going back to work in the mornin, so that means no sleeping in for me.... Off to bed I go :)
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg http://tweetphoto.com/8592485 So do ya still have that big button from STL?! :)
17145858,At the doc with Sophie, possible ear infection.... Hopefully my kids will all be healthy soon!
17145858,@DonnieWahlberg Need more info, you are scaring blockheads worldwide! Take care of yourself, we cannot have all this, without you! :)
17145858,@MTVAftershow @jordanknight LOL That is awesome! Wish I could see it!
17145858,@NicLNew Yes it is! Catch 22 though, it will only be for about a month, and he will miss out on a longer job closer to home :(
17145858,Hubby is going back to work tomorrow! :)

1441801,Pre-watched #accidentallyonpurpose and #theforgotten. Failed to grab us. Gave up #vampire diaries. But watching #thebeautifullife
1441801,@waffles08 if u don't ask for help, it will be overwhelming.
1441801,@waffles08 for what?
1441801,@redbadger but I solved it.
1441801,Mri done. Ankle only cuz I flipped out when they moved my head into the machine. Smallest machine ever.

1441801,Waiting for mini golf. Kinda bored. Lalalalala keep me entertained.
1441801,Never really listen to in-game wow noises. Can hear it now that I am using vent for the first time. Whoa
1441801,@waffles08 probably would not hurt. :)
1441801,@waffles08 r u drinking it?
1441801,Folding laundry. Corey is make cookie dough and organizing the kitchen.
1441801,@redbadger what???? Think about what that may mean. Not something you want to broadcast.
1441801,Everyone gone to demo derby, work, ren fair, and various other outside activities. Back pain = no fun except w/ computer.
1441801,Won my #psych prize pack from thebluesite.com over a month ago and still not rcvd it. Sadness.
1441801,@redbadger dude! Have u called someone yet?
1441801,Watching derek set up his new phone is like watching a chemical reaction......magnetism.
1441801,I hate it.
1441801,I am wondering where my roomate is and why he never brings his gf here anymore. :(
1441801,@potatoduck isn't it coming here?
1441801,@redbadger hot roasted chestnuts anyone? Actually more like sunflower seeds
1441801,MRI got cancelled. Rescheduled for Mon. Good luck cuz josh is taking his test right now.
1441801,I strongely suspect that the tetanus shot they gave me yesterday had flu shot in it. Hmmm nothing is safe. And I feel crappy.
1441801,@waffles08 kfc used to be delivered.
1441801,@waffles08 is everything ok?
1441801,@waffles08 would you like that chicken delivered?
1441801,@waffles08 do you like fast food chicken?
1441801,@redbadger what was the first?
1441801,@redbadger yes! But unless u have a digital convertor for the tv, we ain't watchin til tomorrow.
1441801,My cat knows when I am sick and must attend to me. And sometimes hits me in the face w/ his tail.
1441801,@redbadger I like surprises. Are they quiet?
1441801,@redbadger sure. also can you pick up some fry boxes? Derek said we could get large ones maybe.
1441801,I feel highly traumatized. My eyes are opening. Nauseated. Ummmm wow.

1441801,@waffles08 josh has work at 3 and we have errands and appointments til after 5
1441801,@waffles08 nope. None of us till much later.
1441801,@waffles08 what?
1441801,When do I get to fade away?
1441801,@WhooItsScott well goodness. We need to teach those captioners how to spell don't we ? :p
1441801,@WhooItsScott That's it!!! I am unfollowing you purely for the fact that you spelled it aowyn instead of eowyn. :)
1441801,At mall of america. WOW!
1441801,Choir rehearsal tonight. We'll see!
1441801,I think I am about to go ballistic.
1441801,been up since 730 and this morning is already crap.
1441801,Chiropractor time. Too bad I have only had 7 hours of sleep over the past 2 days cuz of the pain. Ready to feel free!
1441801,After consultation at chiro, I got back tomorrow morning first thing. Hope it helps.
1441801,@psychwrites the suspense is killing me.
1441801,About to leave to go visit the chirpractor. Hopefully he won't make me cry too much.
1441801,@potatoduck its more like IKC.
1441801,Oh and will probably take a lot of pics 2nite since we are all so good looking!
1441801,Oh when oh when will the boys be home? I need to know what kind of time frame to plan for. Gotta shop and make a cake b4 bbq!
1441801,Waiting to make a trip to the crazy mart. At least the house is clean....er. But I'm hungry now. I wish culver's took EBT.
1441801,@waffles08 hmmm perhaps you need to get more wholesome influences?
1441801,@potatoduck good lord how much did you guys drink?
1441801,I can't sleep!
1441801,@potatoduck for sers? Wowie!
1441801,@redbadger is that first as is 1st place or grand prize?
1441801,@potatoduck @redbadger You guys are smashed! I am waiting on who won!!!! Don't leave me hanging.
1441801,Corey basically has been talking to Randy all night. We are supposed to call him tomorrow.
1441801,@redbadger @potatoduck you guys are so smashed!
1441801,@potatoduck i think that to get the discounts you have to have a IATA# which requires cert and a year to qualify.
1441801,@potatoduck I think between the 2 of us we can research really good prices.
1441801,@potatoduck With insurance being #1 and Accounting being #2. Corey found graphic design classes at hennepin tech.
1441801,@potatoduck I think you are right. I can take online classes for it. But I am thinking that is tier 3 in the classes area for me.
1441801,Oh wait...thank you Mahalo! Finally some info!
1441801,Being a travel agent must not be very popular. I can't find certification ANYWHERE!!!
1441801,@potatoduck haha too bad you guys are right sometimes...tough love.
1441801,@potatoduck @redbadger what the heck are you guys talking about?
1441801,@potatoduck they make money by charging businesses and celebs to be higher ranked on "people you should follow" lists.
1441801,Here's sending out good thoughts for Josh's competition. I am there in spirit with my "mommy camera."
1441801,@potatoduck ooooooooo sounds like it's getting exciting!!!
1441801,When the boys aren't here I live in borington. Its cuz I have no formal job so the days just melt together.  what r u doing for labor day?
1441801,Probably a good thing I am not going to fair as my back hurts.....A LOT. Also feel fairly groggy this morning. *sigh*
1441801,Watching Zack and Miri. Sad about not going to state fair :(
1441801,@redbadger yeah!!!! What kind of posters??? :)
1441801,@redbadger Thats a matter of opinion.
1441801,@potatoduck we would come now if we could find a place to sleep :)
1441801,@waffles08 They are at state fair.
1441801,Missing the lively boys. No derek convo tonight! :(
1441801,@redbadger Garrison keillor is there tonight. Just so ya know!

1441801,@Psych_USA We generally go around saying "You know that's right!"
1441801,I feel like I am having an out of body experience. It could just be my stuffy head and congestion drugs.
1441801,RT ah! I want! But need device for it @Psych_USA:  Behold! You asked for it, we produced it.The iPhone Case. Available in 2 weeks for $14.95
1441801,Have a lot of chest congestion and can't breathe.
1441801,RT me! But I have a blacberry so we always get dissed.  @Psych_USA: NEW! Who wouldn't want to carry Shawn & Gus around in their pocket?
1441801,@WhooItsScott maybe you should just move? Corey just got a job after only 2 weeks of looking.
1441801,Woke up unable to speak and throat swollen shut. Wish I could have tonsils removed.
1441801,RT @moonfrye:  If I could tell the president one thing, I would say...you want change? Reform comes from within.
1441801,Almost finished making dinner, but no one is here :(
1441801,Connect the dots....la la la la.
1441801,Ummm so...should we just make dinner or wait and go grocery shopping after josh gets off?
1441801,Just spent the last hour leveling up my tailoring skills on wow. Basically I set it and forget it....and cleaned at the same time!
1441801,@waffles08 I thought saturday!
1441801,@redbadger we are almost done!
1441801,@waffles08 cuz we have not the money
1441801,I want to go to state fair but don't think it will happen.

1441801,Just saw a guy with a dunder mifflin tshirt at target. That's kinda cool.
1441801,@potatoduck I'm slightly bored and low energy, can't you tell?
1441801,@culvers just moved to minnesota from cali (where there are no culvers). This place is so amazing! How does the west coast survive?
1441801,@WhooItsScott I love #psych!
1441801,It's 9pm. Do you know where your Derek is?
1441801,Corey made pudding cake w/ cream cheese frosting! Sooooo good!
1441801,The boys in my life tend to fall asleep abruptly.
1441801,Was soo tired an hour ago. Now I am slightly awake!
1441801,Can I sleep during the day and work at night? It's cooler. Need more fans! I know, wait a few months for the freeze right?
1441801,Funniest thing tonight is watching heidi montag perform on the miss universe pageant (yeah hulu). For sers? Who is she kidding?
1441801,@redbadger only hour and a half to go. And you get to sleep in tomorrow!
1441801,Just had dream where performed in a one act. Wondering if I should try to write it before I forget. The dialogue sucks though.
1441801,@potatoduck okay dokey. :)
1441801,I feel this overwhelming need to go watch pirates....  :)
1441801,Basically all the horses revolve around josh.
1441801,We are at saddle club with josh until 9 or 930ish. Getting lots of pics and video to post!
1441801,@WhooItsScott yeah but it costs like 30 bucks a month for wifi if you get it from like verizon. And you can only use it for 5mb.
1441801,Gonna empty the dishwasher and put dirty in. And this is the highlight of my day....sigh.
1441801,I'm kinda getting restless.
1441801,@waffles08 yeah, it's been a week already.
1441801,@potatoduck you know, when the stinky smells come from the bathroom.

1441801,I am restless!!!!!!! I wanna do something!!!!! Josh let's do something!!!!!!
1441801,@waffles08 Yes and the sooner people learn how to figure that out, the sooner you will find the people you can trust.
1441801,@waffles08 You don't have the answers at 15. you don't even have the answers at 40.
1441801,Geez I have no idea what the heck is happening....sad. Much stress i guess.
1441801,Unless you all want to know the mundane stuff, but I am not sure the people who follow me really care about that.
1441801,Kinda funny how there is nothing to tweet about anymore!
1441801,@WhooItsScott Just trying to keep you motivated :)

1441801,Should I be furious about this? What can I do?
1441801,Time spent waiting for my tutee to be ready is almost a lifetime. I like to make the most of my time, and this is excruciating!
1441801,@psychwrites Is it Sylvester? Would Shawn's dad be that mean?
1441801,If I knew I was gonna be blown off this much for tutoring, I would have left for minnesota already.
1441801,@Psych_USA I am soooo psyched for the new season! Hehe
1441801,I love how my cat likes to stand guard when I am in the bathroom. Like I will be attacked by invisible toilet paper monsters.
1441801,Now that I am 2 days behind on tutoring and have 10 plus labs to input, I'm thinking we may not finish before we leave. Not my fault!
1441801,Seriously....I am getting restless. And a little uneasy. Breath deep.
1441801,Just watched 3 eps of true blood and worked on @redbadger 's blanket. My finger are falling off! :)
1441801,@WhooItsScott "The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit"? WOW
1441801,@potatoduck whooooo! I am bored
1441801,@potatoduck poor you. That sucks. We stayed up until 4 and 5 am respectively, and try to get up by 10. We will be wacked by new time chge.

1441801,@redbadger I want to go there!
1441801,Also corey found him working on the math portion with his friends last night. I am sort of impressed. For about 2 seconds.
1441801,No tutoring today means I can do whatever I want. At least he was responsible enough to let me know beforehand. He's learning!
1441801,@potatoduck twisted bunny
1441801,@redbadger hard to tell when you don't use an @reply! :)
1441801,@redbadger I am NOT enjoying it!
1441801,Trying to play wow while listening to wow podcast. My computer sucks for playing. Had to restart like 4x. And horde killed me.
1441801,@waffles08 it tastes like feet. It's saliva and bad breath....ew
1441801,@potatoduck ummmm wow!
1441801,Tried to teach @cdestel how to play wow. It's not his thing.
1441801,@potatoduck is kate eating tacos?
1441801,@redbadger And we can't wait to leave...believe me! Not looking forward to 28 hours of driving with wailing kitty though!
1441801,@potatoduck We are gonna write up more ideas for the movie theater..is that cool?
1441801,@potatoduck BINGO!!!!!
1441801,Saw #theuglytruth ....well it was ugly. Blog post on @ETApeeps to come!
1441801,@redbadger do you not know what causes blindness?
1441801,@redbadger josh- how is your right hand?
1441801,Waiting to watch ugly truth. Have some wild ideas for starting a theater.
1441801,Twss means that's what she said.
1441801,@potatoduck TWSS!
1441801,@potatoduck too bad. Nobody knows what you are talking about. It's easy for me cuz of my app, but if you do it manual it's prob harder.
1441801,@potatoduck omg you did an actual @reply!
1441801,Playing wow....for the rest of the night!
1441801,@psych_usa when feeling down watching #psych cheers me up, no doubt.
1441801,The scale says I lost 82 pounds since last week. That can't be right!
1441801,Omg smart alecs....eh. I was one and now I work with one. Karma.
1441801,Just saw a headline with a pic of michelle obama that says "Obama's garden tainted." Ummm did someone proof this?
1441801,@adammshankman I like you either way :) movies plus tv plus tweets w/ shankman equals good!
1441801,@potatoduck ha! Some cars are not worth the 4500 they were being paid for. Buy new cars? Really? Fix the job situation!
1441801,looking at rawhide pics makes me sad
1441801,and that live tweet interview is @Psych_USA with James Roday and Dule Hill
1441801,def of multitasking: updating BBapp world on my BB, monitoring a live tweet interview, and catching up on my google reader.
1441801,@potatoduck i just miss ya
1441801,@redbadger I will be playing later, after dinner. Probably another hour or so. Do you still need help?
1441801,On the plus side, he is zipping through this unit with no help from me. It makes me less annoyed.
1441801,Knock on the door "do you wanna tutor now?" Huh never mind I had to cancel my dinner plans! Grrrrrr
1441801,Still waiting for tutoring. *sigh* just wasted my afternoon and parents did not even give me the courtesy of notice. Playing wow now grrr
1441801,@potatoduck what does that mean?
1441801,Still no tutoring. Looks like I'll be forced to tutor saturday.
1441801,2 o'clock. supposed to be tutoring but there is no one here. I have no idea what's going on.
1441801,i think i will go write articles for the blog no one reads.
1441801,@potatoduck why doesn't he? i thought it did not work?
1441801,@Psych_USA Why can't Gus or Shawn ever stay with a girl long term?
1441801,@Psych_USA Why are there no Psych outs on the first season dvd?
1441801,I wonder how far back we will push tutoring tonight. My bro never went to 2 sleepovers a week. Times have changed.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes que paso?
1441801,#sytycd brandon and kayla were awesome. Melissa...blah.
1441801,@potatoduck lalalalalala I'm bored! Commercials...eh!
1441801,#sytycd can melissa ever not dance like a ballerina?
1441801,Btw I have the munchies and it's not my fault!
1441801,#sytycd excellent guys dance. Ade was clunky, kayla was flailing. So far I am rooting for evan and jeanine.
1441801,Watching #SYTYCD! This is gonna be tough.
1441801,@redbadger no prob. Do u have a time frame?
1441801,I love that I must be ready at a moment's notice to tutor. Keeps me on my toes.
1441801,Dear Weather Man: You lie! You say it's 87, cooler than yesterday, but it's really hotter, hence the sweatiness.
1441801,Just sweated off like 5 pounds just sitting here. Ugh
1441801,Wow I was just retweeted by @thewbdotcom  ..... how cool is that?
1441801,@thewbdotcom just entered and would really like the PSP since our PS2 just broke! :)
1441801,Twitter seems to be dropping some of my tweets that i should be receiving. Is that happening to anyone else?
1441801,@psych_USA is it @carltonlassiter or @det_lassiter ?
1441801,Woke up before corey which means...troll time on wow!
1441801,Why is it when I wake up that my joints and muscles ache like I've been lifting weights?
1441801,@Psych_USA I use ubertwitter. Great app!
1441801,Watching rhps on tv. It has captions so it's good. Got to lvl 50 on my dwarf, just trying to finish some quests!
1441801,Finally done with tutoring. Gonna lvl my dwarf up to 50 and then my troll up to 20 tonight. Oh yes!
1441801,Started late (4pm) to tutor today. They had dr appt. Gotta squeeze it in b4 7 due to tae kwon do. *sigh* priorities!
1441801,RT @feliciaday: Levelling my 60 Dwarf Priest in WOW to marry @vork and his RL wife in-game and this is the outfit she has http://bit.ly/ ...
1441801,@potatoduck wait got a msg. I will call her tomorrow since I have tutoring soon.
1441801,@potatoduck did you call? I was away from phone for awhile.
1441801,Just updated my pic by making a "mad men" avatar. What do you think?
1441801,Since I have not played #wow since last thursday, I will be playing it sometime today. Promise!
1441801,Watched all the #sdcc panels I could find online. Thanks nbc. Fox, I sad :(. Abc, urgh for pulling some clips from your lost panel!
1441801,How is everyone this morning?
1441801,Two days later and I stil am having trouble walking. This has not happened in awhile.
1441801,@potatoduck I get it all but the fish...what's that?
1441801,@redbadger what test?
1441801,@WhooItsScott if you need help we can call you and walk you through it.
1441801,To bed after an exhausting day at #sdcc. It just reinforced the fact that I am socially awkward.
1441801,Chillin w/ @love_reilly and @heartfeltmadnes
1441801,Missed @nathanfillion and seth green. But saw @feliciaday. Tired as heck and waiting for the train to go back.
1441801,Just got a picture with @feliciaday. I look dorky. #sdcc
1441801,Trying to remain calm and upbeat.
1441801,Seems like there is no swag today. Less people, but stuff is cleaned out. :( #sdcc
1441801,Ended up getting a wheelchair anyway. People don't care if they run right into you.
1441801,Umm so how do you run out of comic-con lanyards when you have pre-registered 3 months in advance?
1441801,On amtrak to san diego. Train can't go fast enough.
1441801,Waiting for the darn train. http://mypict.me/e8mB
1441801,Going to comic-con.

1441801,Can't sleep. Gotta be up at 5am to leave for comic-con :(
1441801,Comiccon tomorrow. Corey is so excited he can't sleep.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes who was driving?

1441801,I hate being irish sometimes. I feel rage and hurt too deeply.
1441801,@dizzyfeet is right! Dear katie haters-  #1 her main profession is acting. #2 even n'sync can't sing and dance w/o being out of breath.
1441801,@redbadger happy birthday!
1441801,@redbadger what movie is mine josh?
1441801,@redbadger here's one for you.   "You smell like afteshave and taco meat."

1441801,My eyes are watering. I am allergic to something in this house.
1441801,#sytycd melissa's cha-cha looks like DWTS week 4! Too fluid. They kinda stink.
1441801,Ok ellen on sytycd tonight...she is soooo funny on the panel. I am dying.
1441801,@waffles08 though I try to hide it, it's clear, my world crumbles when you are not near!
1441801,Want to play wow but have grocery shopping, dinner, and #SYTYCD first.
1441801,The plus side of tutoring- More time to update my facebook, twitter, and google reader. Been at it for 2 and 1/2 hrs! 21 of 45 to go.
1441801,Bad things happen in 3s. The 3rd pitchman died- Taco Bell Chihuahua!
1441801,@redbadger ME too!!!! What do they have there fried on a stick?
1441801,It's gonna be a fight to the death between me and my student. But I'm gonna win. Even if I die in the process.

1441801,There are so many funny subtle things in this movie that you miss the first time. #halfbloodprince
1441801,@potatoduck we have a small suv now! Can you say tailgate party? Whoooo.
1441801,Kinda restless. Wish I had something to do while watching the movie. R there driveins in minnesota?
1441801,Drive in baby! HP6 and T4 (again) http://mypict.me/bTQZ

1441801,Waiting for my tutee to get his butt in gear so I can do my job. I have other things to do than wait!!!!
1441801,@potatoduck i'm glad it's abnormal.
1441801,@potatoduck so that is abnormal? Sadness. Hey either way, I'm ok. I just like cooler weather.
1441801,@EthanSuplee Unfortunately I have no life and fewer followers so I say more often!
1441801,@redbadger haha we are so opposite. Corey and I hate hot weather and are longing for the coolerness of minn. You don't wanna be in 115heat
1441801,Tutoring and then to riverside til monday. It's gonna be a hot one!
1441801,@WhooItsScott there are multiple drivers in one car?
1441801,Wish I could sleep. The past is plaguing me.
1441801,Just got my invite for Google Voice. Free calls from my computer!!! It so rocks.
1441801,@rdmmp True! Although the super walmarts in Hemet/ San Jacinto don't.
1441801,Whatever happened to coin opperated rides in front of stores? They were the bomb!
1441801,@potatoduck play what?
1441801,This is starting to concern me. 3rd migraine this week.
1441801,The heat is making me feel like I am suffering from heat exhaustion. Headache and backache....urgh!
1441801,The weather report on my phone is reporting light drizzle but there is not a cloud in the sky.
1441801,just cleaned out my email box. Feels good. Now if I could just get rid of my back and head ache.
1441801,@potatoduck which property?
1441801,I know it's not clear but my cat is giving me a dirty look bcuz I am about to kick him off my side of the bed. http://mypict.me/aLfm

1441801,@love_reilly i love when kitties do that!
1441801,@potatoduck I think you just send it using txt msg. I don't remember tho. I use blackberry so I have an app.
1441801,This ep of The Closer is fantastic!
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes yeah!!! CUTIE! What will you call the kitty?

1441801,This building did not exsist when I went to college. http://mypict.me/9Fww
1441801,Waiting to eat lunch outside my old college. Too many people, always crowded. But good food and many choices. Hmm I don't like crowds.
1441801,@waffles08 that may be true! We are all weirdos in different ways :)
1441801,@waffles08 wait til u hang with us. We are all weirdos!
1441801,@WhooItsScott I was wondering bcuz we have a verizon phone we aren't using. But since it's att it won't work.
1441801,@WhooItsScott what carrier do you have?
1441801,Weeded through stuff to decide what to take to minnesota. Includes: hp books, warm clothes, and a chefs knife.
1441801,Bored. Playing wow is sucking. Nothing else to do in riverside.
1441801,Will probably go see star trek at the cheapie theater (have free pass n-e way) it's either that or 17 again.
1441801,@potatoduck are you high?
1441801,After watching @feliciaday on kevin pollucks show, I have decided my book wil rewritten into web series. Never thought I could til now.
1441801,Sweating. On my way to riverside. Ugh.
1441801,In honor of the new HP movie, send your house over twitter. I am #ravenclaw.
1441801,@WhooItsScott I am #ravenclaw!
1441801,3 days this week of missed tutoring = less money for us :(
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes YESSSSS!!!! Wish I could afford starbucks, but pepsi will have to do.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes who let's their kids go out like that? Geez!
1441801,Woke up after having intense migraine last night. Want to work today. Hope I can.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes more what?
1441801,Feels like the top part of my body is really weak. I hate when allergies make me have respir problems.
1441801,It's the magic hour...where evry1 is asleep but me. At least hubby and I are watching true blood marathon.
1441801,@WhooItsScott what's more funny is that u woke up and immediately thought "I should tweet this!" Tech is awesome.
1441801,@potatoduck if that's what she said, you need new moves.
1441801,@redbadger need a tank for a dungeon. Can u get on?
1441801,@redbadger will u teach me how to shot when we get to minnesota?
1441801,Visitation this weekend. 2nd to last time I may see dano in awhile.
1441801,@love_reilly we have the same plans? Fab!
1441801,Why does every freakin movie I watch right now make me cry?
1441801,@redbadger the fact that you watch christmas movies in july is freakin awesome.
1441801,work on my book. I am fully too hard on myself.
1441801,i love how it's midnight and I am too hot to sleep and my eyes are too tired to do anything else. Would like to either crochet or...
1441801,Played WOW for far too long today. Is this the boring/cheapness that is my life? Sunburn about gone so I can swim tomorrow.
1441801,@WhooItsScott go in there and look for me...i dare ya!
1441801,@potatoduck me. Plus I just sent u some good stuff. Read the email.
1441801,Trying to eat an orange and it makes me nauseated.
1441801,Dude! There is a reporter at on mtv at the memorial who is Kim from Top Model!
1441801,@love_reilly but i get your point! true.
1441801,maybe it's not the same caliber, but everyone should be remembered.
1441801,@love_reilly Don't mean the crowds. And I hate funerals too. I mean people forget poor Farrah right now.
1441801,RT @RyanSeacrest: Was thinking we all have a new appreciation for his music now...its kind of wrong that it takes a death to do that
1441801,I feel bad for the families of Fawcett, Mays, McMahon...etc. Must suck to have their deaths overshadowed by this show.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes cool let us know!
1441801,Watching MJ memorial. I guess even I can't stay away from this madness.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes oooo when are you coming :)
1441801,How many more nights of this? Someone come rescue me.
1441801,i am scared and getting more scared everyday
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes we miss u.
1441801,@potatoduck poor u. What can I do?
1441801,@potatoduck need chocolate
1441801,@redbadger they make her cringe...everybody can't like everything. That's want makes us so different, right?
1441801,@potatoduck i liked that movie! Lysee will not touch them with a 10 foot pole!
1441801,@potatoduck we need to start marking money cuz we need to update our computers. Oh and new mp3 players would be good :) among other things!
1441801,@potatoduck we'll see! Hard for us to get ahold of him but we will try.
1441801,@potatoduck Corey's nephew works at blizzard and gave me a year's subscription. Gotta use it!
1441801,Waiting for the Closer to be over so I can play WOW. Have not been on in a few days!
1441801,@WhooItsScott can you call them to follow up? Let them know you really want it!
1441801,@waffles08 we've never met, but we will soon! Here is sending you feelings of strength anyway.
1441801,@WhooItsScott but speak the truth!
1441801,My sunburn still hurt. Argh.
1441801,The snuggie? Why don't you just wear a sweater and put the blanket on your lap? Saves u $20!
1441801,Watching #psych and cleaning out my music disc to prepare for the move.
1441801,@grantimahara #Nerdvana Meeting cast of Dr. Horrible at Comic-con & and then playing WOW when taking a break!
1441801,Looking up MN state fair. maybe we will get to go since we missed Del Mar!
1441801,as if we needed more of a sign, we just finished wobegon days on tv, and my new book takes place in MN. Here's your signs.
1441801,@potatoduck I have different definitions for hotness. Maybe I should say I hate summer.
1441801,Sunburn hurts, waiting for the temp to go up. I do not like hotness!
1441801,No fireworks for us. Maybe we will see them from the house. But I have sunburn!
1441801,Rude people at walmart. It's the 4th for goodness sake. Why can't we be nice?
1441801,@WhooItsScott mustard and relish! Yum.
1441801,Look where we are. :) http://mypict.me/7FbZ
1441801,@potatoduck excellent! Coding and billing for hospitals?
1441801,@potatoduck yuy yup! Should I learn accounting?
1441801,@megangark what's wrong? Do u all need to meet us @ #sonic for some tasty fun?
1441801,It's amazing how much derek's twitter pic looks like ashton kutcher's
1441801,@potatoduck what will u be taking? What should I be taking? :)
1441801,@potatoduck as much as I think the govt is letting us down, I am never sure it's gonna change, which breeds apathy.
1441801,@potatoduck also against the fact that business owners can't pay for adequate health insurance for their employees.
1441801,@redbadger who knows. But we have drug dealers living behind us so that could have been them too.
1441801,@potatoduck I'm just against capitolists who come by their wealth dishonestly and knowingly take advantage of their employees
1441801,It seems someone has eaten all our food so we must go out and get more. Who could have done that? :)
1441801,@love_reilly water is the essence of wetness. Plus I'm really ridiculously good looking.
1441801,@potatoduck never been to a waffle house.
1441801,@potatoduck ooooo soup plantation!
1441801,@potatoduck oh yeah I forgot that u do consis ot "everyone"
1441801,Everyone is posting that they are sick today. We may just stay home too. Walmart trip seems treacherous!
1441801,Looking for something to do on the 4th. Anyone have any plans or ideas?
1441801,@potatoduck ahhhhh u r making me hungry!
1441801,@potatoduck and let the hate mail roll in.
1441801,@redbadger trying to get a job for a month?
1441801,@megangark We'll let u know how things are in minnesota. So far it looks like the weather is pretty groovy.
1441801,Most people think rainy days are the lazy ones. Sitting in front of fire...etc. Hot days are like that 4 me. I'm irish!
1441801,Woke up this morning sweating already. Ugh. Hate when it's too hot to sleep at night.
1441801,@megangark I know. It's pathetic. Hence our need to move. Cali is getting ridiculous.
1441801,Apparently cali is not only a state of fiscal emergency, it is now paying with IOUs. Glad I am moving!
1441801,High on second hand pot smoke. Ummm yeah.
1441801,@love_reilly someone please what?
1441801,Is it really wednesday?
1441801,Slow twitter night obviously.
1441801,@rdmmp monsoon! That's awesome!
1441801,Watching Ace of Cakes. I wish I could make cakes that awesome!
1441801,I've noticed that my daytime tv consists of a lot of food network, tlc, & bbc america. Summer tv sucks!
1441801,After watching seas 1 of #theguild I have decided that mine sucks.
1441801,Watching #theguild for the first time since my wow addiction.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes ewwww. How r u btw?
1441801,@WhooItsScott where?
1441801,For u derek.  RT @BarackObama: Holding online town hall on health care reform this Weds.  submit your q's: http://bit.ly/U3pgV #healthcare09
1441801,Takes forever to pack stuff up and make it back to hemet. And it's gonna be HOT too.
1441801,@redbadger mmmmk. Like a pitchfork?
1441801,Commercials make me bored. Short attention span.
1441801,Waited until 9pm to eat dinner. Bad idea. Also water turned off and I need a shower!
1441801,@waffles08 what did u do?
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes at least they didn't find the contraban pez...am I right?
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes how long is this flight?
1441801,@love_reilly is puzzle pirates a mini game on wizard 101
1441801,It's a tease, I know.
1441801,Is going home to show the nephews that wow is definitely more superior to wizard 101. Also more adult, so they can't play it now.
1441801,@WhooItsScott we learned this natasha richardson too.
1441801,New death today- though not as prolific. The oxy clean man died of a head injury.
1441801,I need new shoes. Plastic sandles suck.
1441801,@feliciaday Happy birthday!
1441801,yup my hubby don't have to share no more!!! i can game when I want. Oh and write my book.
1441801,Computer fixed now. Woot.
1441801,@potatoduck wow! It's all very fun sounding over there. Btw I think I will like the weather very much.
1441801,@potatoduck then why did he say you were asleep? And why are you frustrated?
1441801,@redbadger well at least he's not frustrated!
1441801,@potatoduck what's wrong?
1441801,@redbadger what's like summer camp?
1441801,Here they are- the monkeys! http://mypict.me/69yF
1441801,Phone is dying eeeep! U can't reach me til I get home.
1441801,@potatoduck how was your interview?
1441801,Good lord! Between Lysee, Reilly, and now Megan, I may have to go to chipotle for dinner.
1441801,@love_reilly what's wrong?
1441801,I hate commercials
1441801,@love_reilly Can't find ginger. And I am already having digestion problems so paprika is bad also. Spice girls then?
1441801,@whooitsScott reading bermudez triangle. Good so far!
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes yeah. And quite frankly it was little offputting to turn on wow and see people talking about it. Trying to escape darn it!
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes why? Because of MJ?
1441801,Michael jackson and farrah fawcett dead in one day. If keith richards goes it's armageddon.
1441801,@heartfeltmadness to corey yup.
1441801,The end of the world must be close. Everyone is dying.
1441801,@love_reilly getting cocktails
1441801,I'm not intentionally mean. Just firm. Heck I got him through language in a week and a half.
1441801,@heartfeltmadness @love_reilly his friends are here. So he is acting all mighty and rude. He is like "this is not the military."
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes we are waiting for your dad to talk to us. Apparently ian is complaining of us being too mean.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes I think I might. Dealing with ian drama also...not good.
1441801,Thanks. I feel like hangover, nausea, weakness, headache...is this the flu?
1441801,I am done. I hurt people. I am a crappy person. Done.
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes what ultimatum or u being given?
1441801,Is really sorry I cause so much trouble for everyone. Excuse me while I crawl under the covers.
1441801,@rdmmp maybe I can tell u later. It's just too hard right now.
1441801,@rdmmp I just don't know.
1441801,I just don't care anymore.
1441801,@redbadger how short?
1441801,What the heck is up with these producers leaving Heroes so abruptly? I fear it may have jumped the shark.
1441801,Just chillin'. Playing wow. Woop!
1441801,@redbadger is there a new bertha?
1441801,@potatoduck why do you ask?
1441801,Time to get in line. It's soooo long!
1441801,Pays to wait. This large family just grabbed handfuls of tanks and moved to another table to sort. I waited and grabbed their leftovers!
1441801,Now just looking at other stuff waiting for the line to go down. Love the oceans 11 music playing. It's very appropriate!
1441801,Got em! Was hoping for black in color but this family snatched practically everything in my size.
1441801,Is this worse than black friday?
1441801,8 min. And counting.
1441801,Starting to stress! Breath.......
1441801,Why did I do this by myself? A bad decision in hindsight I'm thinkin'.
1441801,20 min. 20 min. Someone entertain me. I hate crowds.
1441801,Wonder if this is gonna be like guerilla warfare. A mad fight for th tanks! Thankfully only 5 per customer.
1441801,Already 20 people in line @ old navy and it does not open for haf an hour. I'm a loser too!
1441801,@heartfeltmadnes does this mean you will be on now? U must find me.
1441801,@potatoduck too bad it's only womans. Perhaps we should claim discrimination?
1441801,Up early to get $2 old navy tanks!
1441801,@megangark oh no! What's wrong?
1441801,I am totally playing wow. Nightly before bed ritual. Helps me get to sleep.
1441801,My kitty loves his condo! http://mypict.me/4vO8
1441801,@potatoduck what time?
1441801,@WhooItsScott good night! Us insomniac night owls sure get stuff done around this time.
1441801,@rdmmp nope. The ipod was a hand me down and it lasted a long time. The ps2 was a refurb already. Good deals but oh well!
1441801,@redbadger are they tv or real life boobies?
1441801,@waffles08 it's so hard! It's a journey though. And so worth it in the end. You're young, plenty of time :)
1441801,@waffles08 good advice! Wait for the one who wants to stay.
1441801,Dear # sytycd: please do not put the captioning at the top of the screen over their faces. Thanks!
1441801,I kinda feel like my family closely resembles the twister family. Derek is so dusty. Josh is rabbit.
1441801,My cat is seriously watching "twister" likes it's the most fascinating thing ever.
1441801,@rdmmp what may he be promoted to?
1441801,@megangark what would you rather be doing?
1441801,Nap or wow? Hmmm depends on if my body can function on very little sleep today.
1441801,@potatoduck whatever works. As long as u are doing it! But just don't be what you hated being. Do you know when u are crossing the line?
1441801,@WhooItsScott I got my copy from paperbackswap yesterday. Will read it when I am done with "specials"
1441801,@potatoduck desperation makes us more effective?
1441801,@potatoduck keep pushin! Well it depends on who you want to kill. Wait I know the answer to that. Just kidding.
1441801,@potatoduck I admire you!
1441801,@potatoduck of many? How many?
1441801,@potatoduck aye! We would send u money if we had some. Isn't fri your court date?
1441801,@potatoduck I wanna help. How can I help?
1441801,@megangark ha! No life trouble. Lack of being able to find a job here. Entertaining thoughts of moving elsewhere. Can't afford it.
1441801,Can't help it. i don't know how much longer I can do this
1441801,Should we just fade away?
1441801,Don't know who to talk to. But I am a little freaked.
1441801,I am trying to be more upbeat but the more we are here, the more I feel like we shouldn't be. I feel trapped. Can't afford to move anywhere
1441801,I think I have kennel cough! *cough cough*
1441801,@megangark yeah and according to commercials for the show, they don't really get along.
1441801,@WhooItsScott I do "smile everyone!"-basil of baker st.
1441801,I am going to have a nervous breakdown. Seriously.
1441801,Strangely paranoid.

17538568,can you get dehydrated from crying too much?  I don't think I've ever cried as much watching TV as I did tonight watching The Biggest Loser.
17538568,@BlueJeanGourmet no doubt - they could do Real Housewives of EWS with no shortage of stars.

17538568,Of course, half an hour ago he tossed and turned and couldn't breathe - now he wants to play with the ducks outside.
17538568,At hospital with dylan = fever, croup, and having attacks where he can't breathe. Anyone still jealous of all my kids? Sickness multiplies.

17538568,@birbigs I agree, come back to Houston!  We miss you!
17538568,Still haven't actually SEEN this coworker in office just lights on like they SHOULD be. Like they had to piss on it to reclaim it. Doom on u
17538568,I don't care if anyone can figure out who I'm talking about. Sometimes this coworker is a pompous self-righteous shitpurse. Whew. Felt good.
17538568,Not actually in it but doors are open & lights R on. Hasn't been that way since school started but now that could go away, they live there.
17538568,Coworker never uses large office b/c has other office. I work in closet.  Facilities wants me to have lg office. Coworker is in office now
17538568,Need tex-mex. Intravenously. Red sauce on one side, chile con queso on the other. Crap, now my mouth is watering. Sounds like early lunch!

44382895,@sophiastjames you got our name wrong. :(
44382895,RT@sophiastjames: *Tonight- Queer Cornucopia@ Invasion, 9p, $15. Come dance w/ the Man!*RT @BuckAngel:Go Buck Yourself! http://bit.ly/d0cy3n
44382895,@_Tiganca_ Not ego, it's being human. Everyone needs to be shown they are cared for sometimes. It's important.
44382895,@_Tiganca_ Their excuse, "I didn't ask you to throw one for me." Assholes!
44382895,@_Tiganca_ I totally get that one. I always plan everyones parties. I was bummed on my bday last year cuz no one did for me....
44382895,@_Tiganca_ Damn, that does suck. Hope your bday goes well after work. If I knew you I'd throw you a party. You seem nice.
44382895,@FrontAve yeah magical powers & being zombified... That's quite terrifying if you stop to think about it!
44382895,Bahahaha!!! Gross. :p  RT_Professor_: OH at work this morning: "How did it come? Big and in chunks."  Tasty...
44382895,@Liszilla Are you coming to Go Buck Yourself tonight? Go-go's for every orientation & performances by super sexy people, like @BuckAngel!!!
44382895,@WetTogether Woo hoo! Thanks for taking the time. It's much appreciated. :)
44382895,@CisMasque One would think... Let's just hope it's not contagious!
44382895,@Liszilla Sounds like you had a blast! Glad you enjoyed yourself. :) How was the club? I've heard very mixed reviews.
44382895,If you like Steampunk & video games, get this! RT @Catwoman69y2k: My friend Matt is having an auction for his necklace: http://ping.fm/CJi4w
44382895,@FrontAve OMG! The unicorns totally could have taken those zombies. Those damn weenie horses. Bite their zombie heads off!
44382895,@nerdliness Such a great series, though I didn't think that till about episode 3. I was sad it ended so abruptly though. :(
44382895,@CisMasque Steaming crotch? That doesn't sound very healthy.
44382895,@_Tiganca_ That sucks! Sorry to hear your co-workers are royal douchebags. No one should have to work on their birthday.
44382895,@killorn Depends, vintage Vespa or newfangled vespa?
44382895,@mia_matsumiya Sure, it's okay love. I'm sure no Russians were offended by it, maybe vegetarians, but who cares!

44382895,@WetTogether Oh, since we drop ship our items right now, we get it from Honeys Place. Not the best drop shippers, but the best on West Coast

44382895,@WetTogether Buy what from? Our Wet lube?
44382895,Adorable! RT @Albinism: Yes, there is :) - http://twitpic.com/17yd3l/full  -- RT @lifelessssoul: there's such a thing as albino kangaroo o.O
44382895,@WetTogether Plus with "wet" being in our name almost everything comes up when searching it... I need to change that so only lube shows.
44382895,@WetTogether I try. Wet is one of my favorite lubes. Great quality & great prices, who can complain! :)
44382895,@sophiastjames That really sucks. I'm sorry to hear that whoever isn't real with you. I don't get people like that, at all.
44382895,@sophiastjames I sent you a DM last night about meeting today. I'll text you later about it too, let me know if that time & place works. :)
44382895,@sophiastjames sounds like you're having a rough morning. Hope it gets better after your nap. :)

44382895,@Valthalion Cool! Post a pic when you're done, I wanna see!
44382895,@kaylani_lei A Q-tip with rubbing alcohol should clean it enough so it will work again. I get that problem with my BB.

44382895,Adding a bunch of @WetTogether products to the site, trying to unwind & destress... Quality lube makes me happy. :)
44382895,@sophiastjames So wish I could have made it! :(  Oh well, I'll be there ready to shake my booty on Friday! Got my tickets today. :)

44382895,@Liszilla I would have cried too if it was a surface piercing, they're dermal anchors. Much less painful and easier to take care of. Thanks!

44382895,@badbadgirlx Let him know the dr.s are doing everything they can that his father loves him & if he has ?s or needs to talk you're there.

3582641,@JohnHargrove lol.... So true.  "I can't look away!"
3582641,@JohnHargrove and its weird how they just dropped in this shell bill from last October.  Interesting to say the least.
3582641,@JohnHargrove Fair enough.  But a good bill with competent people behind it should be able to overcome fearmongering.
3582641,@JohnHargrove the more they push for it the worse the polls look.  The election fodder that can be used with audio of O in the past.
3582641,Crazy thing is - this puts more money in the hands of the insurance companies.

3582641,I believe I had to implement every C# Interface available in WCF and Silverlight but it freakin works.
3582641,FINALLY.  I got HTML 5 Sockets to work with Silverlight for a full duplex communication.  Yes, HTML 5.
3582641,@JohnHargrove @rshade We're at a point where the national debt is at a record higher and climbing.  At some point economics win.
3582641,@JohnHargrove @rshade But, he's right.  The money to pay for it wasn't there.  The Dems didn't have it.
3582641,@rshade furthermore, he's pointing out the obvious fiscal hypocrisy of the Dems by holding it up.  It worked.
3582641,@rshade makes good sense to me, and, yes, the amendment failed but he wanted it in the bill before he ended in the block.
3582641,@rshade  http://bit.ly/dykCwK "What was the point of passing pay-go legislation? If Democrats continue to ignore their own rules.."
3582641,@rshade that's cool, be even better if they followed it rather than try to fool people into thinking their responsible.
3582641,@rshade  http://bit.ly/bg6Ldy "but Bunning stood firm until reaching accord on a deal Tuesday."
3582641,@rshade read his arguments, it will make sense then.
3582641,@jenniferlucille @rshade I put down 50% cause I thought I caught the bottom.  I'd own it outright if I did that now. :)
3582641,@jenniferlucille he's the only doctor in his practice and I was guessing on his Salary.
3582641,@jenniferlucille @rshade "Everyone has a right to a home."
3582641,@jenniferlucille @JohnHargrove Yes, he owns his own practice.  In Florida.
3582641,or do we just go straight to the Utopian society from here?
3582641,The question someone is going to have answer at some point is when do jobless benefits end?
3582641,@jenniferlucille @rshade but it is the principle of paying for something first that I like.  It's the reason we're in this mess.
3582641,@ianrichetti this is true.
3582641,@rshade and it worked.  Dems agreed to his demands.
3582641,@rshade because he knew it was a paper tiger.  Now he's holding them to it.  Someone's gotta do it.
3582641,@rshade Bunning?  He's just making congress do what Obama promised - Pay as you Go.  More power to him.
3582641,@ianrichetti I wish congress would take it more seriously rather than the current situation.
3582641,@ianrichetti so, if doctors don't have insurance and malpractice occurs, the patient can go after the hospital.
3582641,@ianrichetti alot of hospitals require coverage in order to operate.
3582641,@JohnHargrove agreed.  And he's an orthopaedic surgeon.  The OB/GYN's I know can barely even get insurance.  Most moved to TX.
3582641,More power to you Bunning.  Make them do what they say.  Novel idea.
3582641,@upsidetrader yeap, me too.  All of the leftist media are going to require a bailout before too long.
3582641,@JohnHargrove I'm not sure to be honest.  Let's say he takes home 1.2M.  That doesn't change the high cost of the MP insurance.
3582641,@upsidetrader yeah, believe it or not Matthews used to sub for Limbaugh many years ago.
3582641,@upsidetrader thus the reason Finerman, thought just "Being There" in Argentina made him understand healthcare.
3582641,@upsidetrader Right on.
3582641,My father-in-law pays $700,000 / year for $900,000 worth of malpractice coverage.  They don't include these stats in tort reform numbers.
3582641,@upsidetrader let's hope so.  Guy wonders why our healthcare costs are high related to Argentina.  Idiot.
3582641,Dear Howard Fineman:  Please take Economics 101.

3582641,@JohnHargrove haha, so true.  Especially these days.  It used to be much better.
3582641,@rshade oh, haha, I was a big Lewis fan before I ever listened to Limbaugh.
3582641,@JohnHargrove Hitchens, in his latest book, said his struggle with Atheism was that it was an absolute negative. Lewis had same prob.
3582641,@rshade That Wikipedia article is missing alot of references and citations.
3582641,@rshade Yes, it was published then.
3582641,@JohnHargrove Quite possible, a few others would be St. Augustine, Lucretius and G. K. Chesterton.
3582641,@rshade Yes, I believe all major works for what he is known for today were written after his conversion from Theism to Christianty.
3582641,@JohnHargrove I believe "The Great Divorce" was a work which was written before his conversion.  Tolkien had a hand in his conversion.
3582641,@JohnHargrove relative to his time, of course.
3582641,@JohnHargrove He was as hardcore as Dawkins is today.  First, he converted to Theism.  Then, years later he converted to Christianity.
3582641,@JohnHargrove During this time he struggled with believing in an absolute negative so he set out to prove it as an absolute positive.
3582641,@mattrehm haha, yeah, being 30 now I do feel older.  Thanks.  :)
3582641,@JohnHargrove Lewis was a hardcore atheist.  His goal in life was to spread atheism as he thought religion caused the turmoil in the world.

3582641,@JohnHargrove lol, I said the same thing about Republicans when they were filibustered.
3582641,@JohnHargrove agree to an extent.  I also think, if that's the route that is taken (even though the dems had 60 seats) anything can happen.
3582641,@JohnHargrove also, I worry about the precedent.  When power changes hands anything is possible.
3582641,@JohnHargrove yeah, I've read that.  It's true, but in this case there is major change to 1/6th of the economy.
3582641,@JohnHargrove i'm not sure who yelled it out.

3582641,Yes, the public monies for abortion is dangerous.  You'll have alot of people stop paying taxes based on their religion.
3582641,yeah, Boehner is nailing it on the constitutional challenges this faces.

3582641,@KatMcKinley the White House bill changed it to 2018.
3582641,How is there 'no time to start over' when the current bill doesn't come into effect until 2018?
3582641,O looks pissed as the Republicans have set the agenda from the get go.
3582641,Lamar tells the truth on reconciliation and its uses in the past.  This is great.
3582641,Lamar:  "Taking all of the profits away from health insurance companies would only pay for 2 days for health insurance for all."
3582641,Lamar comes out swinging immediately... ooorah.
3582641,None of this is new.  None of it.  They don't even have the votes for reconciliation.  This is a display to show 'we tried.' #fb

18604078,@cassieventura  Hey Cassie, are those your vocals on "Venus vs. Mars?"
18604078,@luvmenaturally  HAHAHAHA, maybe thats what they're leaving for!
18604078,@melaniewashere I'm sure she does.  If she was my wife, we'd have 3 albums together like Sonny & Cher
18604078,@ShauJanae5 @melaniewashere when her band put out an album without her, they went under the name Sweetback.  The album was dope too!!
18604078,@melaniewashere ahhhh, I don't believe that. doesn't sound like B to me. I'm gonna ask Cassie on Twitter and ask about those special pics 2.
18604078,http://twitpic.com/12leo9 - @KDW824. You know I'm quick
18604078,@KDW824 doesn't even sound like Beyonce to me at all.
18604078,@melaniewashere @Clarknyss liner notes say Cassie Ventura.  Now her face pops into my head everytime I hear it.
18604078,Knowing this is Cassie's voice on Venus vs. Mars makes me like it even more.
18604078,this movie looks dope RT @digg_entertain: "'The Last Airbender' Full Trailer Arrives (video)" - http://digg.com/d21IP6f?t13

18604078,@Tdiddy2 People are scared, its easier for black people to pull down one of our because we aren't scared of "us"
18604078,@ReeseJ82 I don't know man, nowadays I'd rather get a good ole set of pics, blackberry video or a skype session.
18604078,@Daaeck I told 2 girls that at the Superbowl party.  I told them I like personal porn or videos/pics that women send me.
18604078,@Lurrelle No luck ma'am.  I couldn't do it in IE 8 either.
18604078,@prettyblessed08 You made my Gatorade go down the wrong pipe

18604078,@kikilatrice LOL, you learned it, I'm sure. You're a genius.  You probably forgot that on your road to being a supreme court justice.
18604078,@JRobby84 Hey Jen-Jen, not a smarty pants at all. I'm just trying to be smarter than a 5th grader. ;-)

18604078,@kamikam24 its basically where two separate pieces of the earth meet and when they shift and that energy is released is forms an Earthquake
18604078,Attn: People who are amazed IL had an earthquake... when I was in 5th grade my teacher said that there are fault lines in this state.
18604078,@ChakaTomorrow That's understandable & men don't either. But a lot of women I know choose celibacy after picking the wrong men to sleep with
18604078,Don't be mad at John Mayer for not dating black women.  Reggie Bush doesn't date black women either, but ppl still love him.
18604078,@ChakaTomorrow Because we want sex, odds are someone got your goodies for free, so why should a guy put in QT ?
18604078,@ChakaTomorrow I know a girl who has taken a celibacy claim that had a train ran on her by 4 of my guys, she can't be taken seriously.
18604078,@ChakaTomorrow yes indeed.  dead serious.  We shouldn't have to wait for what is being handed out freely.
18604078,@ChakaTomorrow 1. She is acting like her sex is extra special and may try to hold out or 2. She was a buss a in the past & is trying to 4get
18604078,@ChakaTomorrow I think women see practicing celibacy as a good thing.  To a lot of men that equates to 1 of 2 things.  (cont)

29491253,@mitchyyyyy Not true.  You're just being hard on yourself.  I said "hard on".
29491253,@mitchyyyyy I was expecting the plague. That just means your beer selection will be greatly decreased and you'll be annoying to restaurants.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy Oh noes.  :(  Can I ask what that might be?
29491253,@mitchyyyyy I hope you don't have the zombie virus.  =\
29491253,@bfstevie There.  Donations made.  I feel better.
29491253,Am I going to go to jail for not completing this census form?
29491253,@bfstevie Where do I donate?  I want to give money in the name of my dead, homophobic grandmother.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy Beyonce: "THAT'S MAH MAN!"
29491253,@bfstevie What makes things worse is I've only spoken to my mother a handful of times in the last 6 yrs.. Now my mother is an orphan. Weird.
29491253,@aun_perdido She was crazy, but, its how she was raised and the shitty lot she was dealt in life.  But still, blood is blood.
29491253,The grandmother who wrote me out of her will and hasn't spoken to me in 12+ years has died.  I don't know how to feel.
29491253,@galacticsimian Spring has nearly sprung here.

29491253,@ViciousPotato YOU'RE great.
29491253,Mission accomplished. I will smell funny on the train. Worth it.
29491253,@icanhazxxX why do I have to wait when time/place were decided hours ago?  Now i'm going some place completely different half an hour later!
29491253,Why are dealers so flaky?  Why am I waiting in Whole Foods for some reason while you can't answer a text?  This is no way to do business.
29491253,OK I finally managed to replace my stolen Sandman volume's 2 & 3 (the 1995 printing).  So I now have the whole collection (again)!
29491253,@zzap That plastic thing holds the fabric of the universe together.
29491253,@duncn Hey, that's right!  You're really good at this appraisal thing!  ^5
29491253,@duncn Now what in the world would I need a website for?
29491253,@duncn But it's sooooo shiny...
29491253,It's cold as a witch's tit.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy Your name has a lot of y's in it.
29491253,WHAT?!  I missed the dying of the Chicago River green?!?!  Why didn't that happen on Wednesday???
29491253,Well, my online shopping spree was mostly a success.  I only need to exchange two pairs of pants.
29491253,RT @bfstevie One of my best friends, Kevin, died last night.  He was 57. --- R.I.P. Kevin, my condolences.
29491253,@crazyboy2483 Burn that motherfucker to the ground!!

29491253,@zzap Oooooh!!!  I'm drunken too!!  How iz ur taxi?
29491253,@aun_perdido Why thank you, good sir.  I feel fine, just fine.   :D
29491253,Drunk.  Just FYI.
29491253,@zzap Hello there.. What a night I've had.
29491253,@duncn That's not true!  Give me a few minutes to come up with a compelling argument.
29491253,I got my tax return!!!!  Cha ching!!!!
29491253,@duncn You don't have to be a god, you just have to be not ok with dying.
29491253,@duncn Actually, Olly knows me, and I won't die.
29491253,@icanhazxxX Yes, I hug, squeeze, etc. Them.
29491253,@galacticsimian I have once.  Fried turkey is amazing.
29491253,@icanhazxxX Yeah, two fat kittys.  One is quite bad.
29491253,Lots of security and dogs at the train stations today. One barked at me, which was odd since I left my WMDs at home.
29491253,@RL_Stine The real question is... Why would dying prevent you from continuing to write Goosebumps?
29491253,The Japanese are under the impression we eat fried chicken as an x-mas meal.  On x-mas in Japan one needs reservations for KFC.  No joke.
29491253,Less than 1% of Japan's population is Christian.
29491253,@galacticsimian I hate her.  Her dick is stuffed up inside her vajayjay.
29491253,Well good morning, cats.  I guess you boys want breakfast? http://tweetphoto.com/14115894

29491253,@ViciousPotato Good morning, comrade!
29491253,@WOLF_3D But wouldn't that promote people talking to you?  Do you want that?  I wouldn't!

29491253,@ViciousPotato I would like to wear the coat open, but I would like the option of having it closed up, ya know?
29491253,@ViciousPotato I'd like a trench coat, but I'm picky about them.  Most "contemporary" ones are too short, no good for hiding a sword at all.
29491253,@ViciousPotato Tesla's letterhead: http://icanhaz.com/letterheadt  Have you ever seen this before?
29491253,@ViciousPotato Me too  :(  Like a Chesterfield style, or, fuck it, a greatcoat.  But, it's getting to be too warm here.  Maybe next winter.
29491253,@ViciousPotato Well, yes, but it's such a nice day, I don't think I'll need it!  Maybe just a light jacket.
29491253,Ugh.. not feeling well this morning.

29491253,@_saffron Eat your friend maybe?
29491253,@zzap OK, I'd hate to have to report you to Interpol!  I value our friendship too much to want to have to do that.

29491253,@Peppery =^_^= *purr*  Well hello, kitty.

29491253,@WOLF_3D Well, never would be better, but you're a smart kid, so, i'll accept "not a lot".

29491253,Yup, missed my train. Gonna be late. Meh...
29491253,There are so many aspects of my personality, it's hard to embody myself in an Internet moniker. I think I need a new one.

29491253,These pants seem to have gotten a bit tight...  =/

29491253,Ww, no motivation to leave and go to work today.  I'm going to be late.
29491253,@milkkore Maybe we could round the Christians up and keep them in some kind of camps? That'll keep them in check, right? #historyrepeats

29491253,@mitchyyyyy Waitwait, what is all this nonsense about again?
29491253,@Peppery o^_^o  Awwww... you know I luv you.  Anyway, "phone" denotes fear.  I don't fear your strange kind.  *secretly plots*

29491253,@zzap @mitchyyyyy Tweets with a odd number of characters are female, the ones with even numbered characters are male.  It's science.

29491253,@mitchyyyyy Quiet, you.  DANCE!
29491253,@mitchyyyyy Why don't you just get a sugar daddy like the rest of us?
29491253,I neeeeed some nice new music.  Lately I'm into Arcade Fire, Decemberists, and other so 2007 bands.  Suggestions?

29491253,Gawd, I hate women.
29491253,@galacticsimian I just don't see what's so wrong with it!  I'm still a hardcore Courier guy, really.  Dad?
29491253,@bt_123 I use it to converse and meet people, kind of like IM, but they're pretty different. It won't REPLACE IM though.
29491253,I hope I didn't put too much seasoning in this casserole.  It may be too salty, or too @peppery....
29491253,@bt_123 Oh, hello there!

29491253,@ViciousPotato Good work, Lisa!!! YAY!

29491253,@mitchyyyyy OK I'll leave the light on for you.  The teleportation chamber is all warmed up.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy I DID save you some cupcakes though.
29491253,@duncn Well now I don't feel so bad about stealing some of your photos for my future blog. I joke, I'll link ya. Great stuff though, really.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy I sent it to you via Pony Express on 1/17.
29491253,Remember my ghastly, horrid sword wound?  Well I Tweeted lots of photos.  Anyway, 26 days later, completely healed and scarred over!  YAY!
29491253,I continue to be awesome.
29491253,@zzap I'll take people who think they're geniuses.  I think I'm a sort of genius.. but what kind of genius can't use IRC?  A criminal one.
29491253,@zzap I'll just stick to the few extra cool ones I'm already following.
29491253,@duncn I've been on your Tumblr for.. uhh... like two hours.
29491253,@zzap You're right. Twitter and instant messenger really, some chat. I'm too dumb to use IRC. I don't hang out with any teenagers IRL =\
29491253,@zzap Most of the people from your generation that I associate with ARE geniuses.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy Yeah man, cupcakes and hot gay sex.  @zzap was there too.
29491253,@zzap I wasn't either.  They were just a birthday formality.  Cupcakes were leftovers of the sex & cupcakes from YOUR birthday, actually.
29491253,RT @omegatron Thing melted in my mouth.. *drools* --- #thatswhatshesaid
29491253,@zzap I had him over to my place for sex and cupcakes.

29491253,@ViciousPotato Sounds very stylish.  Peak or notch lapels?
29491253,*cough*  Sorry 'bout that.
29491253,That cupcake just made me hungrier.  FEED IT!!!  FEED THE BEAST!!!  If you let the blood on the wall dry it'll get angry.
29491253,I'm going just a little crazy right now.  Is there LSD in my orange juice?  Again?
29491253,@zzap *mind explodes*  Hello, Odin isn't here right now, he's trapped in a paradox.  Please leave a Tweet.
29491253,@duncn Sounds intense.  I'm a wannabe computer geek.  I just play one on TV.  D:  As soon as I'm interesting I'll have a website!
29491253,@zzap You missed a Tweet from @OdinWednesday at 2MAR2010, 15:46, but the Tweeter did not leave a message.
29491253,@ViciousPotato I knew you would!!  :D  Awesome people don't need a list to tell them they're awesome.

29491253,@duncn :D Thank you, new friend!  Whatchadoin?
29491253,Feeling lonely and friendless. Time to spam message boards.  And my spam I mean comment on.
29491253,Where do all these awesome Tumblr'd photos come from?!!  I've been building a folder full of pics for months and I have nothing.  :(
29491253,@omegatron I bet it's cupcakes... that mean witch is fattening you up! And by mean witch I of course mean the lovely and delightful @monnie.
29491253,@zzap i'll replace her too.
29491253,@omegatron At least it's not an axe in your eye!  Errr... Sorry.
29491253,Your mother.
29491253,@ViciousPotato Well try to feel more persistent!
29491253,Can anyone reccomend a good Australian news source? Something Guardian-esque, or is the Guardian shit too?  Failing at being cultural, here.
29491253,@omegatron Sorry, i'm kind of an idiot at times.   It helps me blend in.
29491253,@omegatron You were saying you had music stuck in your head!  Better than an axe!
29491253,@omegatron At least you don't have an axe stuck in your head.  *ow*

29491253,@aun_perdido That's good to hear!
29491253,@duncn It's allright, a bit expensive though.  There's a lot going on.  It also takes forever to get anywhere.
29491253,@aun_perdido Have you been effected by the earthquake at all?
29491253,@duncn Chicago.  Probably because a majority of my Twitter-folk are Australian.  Maybe one day I will be Australian.  Awfully hot though...
29491253,@duncn A lazy Sunday here.  Watching This Is It.  I think I need a nap.
29491253,Tweet

29491253,@WOLF_3D That was the coolest Tweet ever, in so many ways.
29491253,@galacticsimian Oh.... Now I forgot where I heard that in the first place.
29491253,@bfstevie @WOLF_3D It being a girl did make it extra funny though.

29491253,@mitchyyyyy Fair and balanced, yo.  Bill O'Reilly makes my breakfast every morning.
29491253,@duncn Noooo, it's Italian!  The sauce tastes nothing like vodka really, it's just in there.  It makes the sauce a bit tangy, and orange.
29491253,Baxter and I.  He was trying really hard to go to sleep and I kept making him pose for Booth photos.  HA! http://dailybooth.com/u/20ob2
29491253,Gnocchi with vodka sauce... mmmm...nomnomnomnom
29491253,Or would that be "staring out it"?
29491253,Hahaha, I was going to take the dog for a walk, but then I opened a window and he's all distracted staring out of it.  I'll remain lazy.
29491253,@ScootMcGoof Hahah we were in a nexus of miscommunication.  I was merely exclaiming that I supported them, no reason really.  I <3 interwebz
29491253,@ScootMcGoof *shakes fist angrily at animals*  Damn them and their rights!!  jk of course
29491253,@ScootMcGoof Neither did I?  You said he did great things, and I said yeah thats what put him into power, good ideas and such.  :P
29491253,@ScootMcGoof His ideas and influence certainly got him in his position in the first place.
29491253,@ScootMcGoof Do you think something like a mental illness or drugs set him off and made a turn for the worst?  He did have a good start.
29491253,@duncn A pretty terrible artist, from what I hear.
29491253,@ScootMcGoof Hey!  I support animal rights!!  =0
29491253,Hitler was a vegetarian.  No joke.  Wow, who knew?

29491253,Oh, they were vanilla buttermilk cupcakes with dark chocolate frosting (which I made) and blue sprinkles!!:D I have no clever name for them.
29491253,My cupcakes were a success.  I'm not taking a photo because they were much more delicious than beautiful.  ^_^

29491253,Lost my voice.  Not working today.  I'll be in bed if you need me.  Someone walk the dog for me, OK?
29491253,@GWCChuck I'm kinda disappointed he's not wearing the Karate Kid headband in the clips from the apparent final showdown. Looks good though!
29491253,@_saffron LOL I can't seem to stop wishing him a happy birthday either.  He has us hypnotized I think.
29491253,A sick day tomorrow is sounding better and better.
29491253,@OllyNewport Roy Lichtenstien?
29491253,@OllyNewport Is Olly Newport the artist?
29491253,@zzap Most exciting... SO FAR...   ;)  I have a pet camel waiting for you when you get home.  Surprise!!
29491253,@galacticsimian That's the most adorable thing I've seen all day/week.
29491253,@OllyNewport And I don't think that whale really killed 2 other people.. the evidence is quite shaky.
29491253,@OllyNewport YES!  I agree 100%  I posted a Facebook updated about it last night, basically referring to it as "whale's revenge".
29491253,@galacticsimian Hahaha... that was a good one.  By the way, the answer to number 14 is 3/52
29491253,@galacticsimian Kill them by immolation!!!
29491253,@OllyNewport I don't know about you, but I'm a recovering donut addict... that would be a very bad thing for me.
29491253,*bone crushing birthday hugz*  HAPPY BIRTHDAY,@zzap!!! I hope you have a great one. Any exciting plans? Besides being asleep at the moment.
29491253,YAY!!!  Canada beat Russa 7-3 at the Olympics!!  WOOOO!  Go Canada!  (OK, I won't talk about the #Olympics anymore)
29491253,@duncn Yeah I was looking at 52", but I just can't bring myself to do it.  I found a 42" WITH a home theater system for $200-250 less!!!!!
29491253,@mitchyyyyy A ninja at night and on weekends.  Drone by day.  :D  I answer the phone a lot.
29491253,@mitchyyyyy I work as an office drone at a law firm.  And I'm a ninja.
29491253,@bfstevie I remember!
29491253,@duncn I might be OK.  But I wanted a giant obnoxious TV.  Like 52"  :'(
29491253,Looks like I'm going to have to settle for a 42" TV.  *sigh*
29491253,@mitchyyyyy I wish I could quit my horrid, horrid job.  It makes me want to set things on fire.
29491253,@zzap And would you like a pretentious little coffee cake too?
29491253,@zzap @_saffron I can drink coffee, but I prefer tea.  Zzap, I still have some Twinings, would you prefer that?  No shortbread of course.
29491253,@duncn =O I hate shoes as well.  I'm usually pretty liberated while at home, but here at the office pants are required.  :(
29491253,@_saffron @zzap Wooo!!  I brought little coffee cakes!  Can we wear special coffee party hats?
29491253,@duncn My legs are too white to wear shorts.  No srsly, it's illegal!  I'll be shot if I wear them.
29491253,@duncn Nooo!  Is it still edible, or RIP second breakfast?
29491253,@omegatron I LOVE that movie!!  The "empath" lol.  Kim Jong Il's panthers lol.  Genius.  And they're puppets.
29491253,@omegatron God bless America.
29491253,@galacticsimian ... which I saw in person at the Art Institute, and it was my favorite piece there.

29491253,@bfstevie :D  Why thank you!  What a nice way to start the day.  I am trying to look snazzy today.
29491253,@bfstevie Yeah, I'm pretty sure they designed that emoticon with me in mind.  That's my permanent expression.
29491253,@galacticsimian *blush*  That IS homoerotic!!!  I must read it.
29491253,Woooork... don't WANT to go.  :(  Sad.  Also, I'm STILL sick. http://dailybooth.com/u/1z9u2
29491253,@ViciousPotato If the heat doesn't kill the elderly, I will.

29491253,LET THE BAKING MADNESS BEGIN!!!!!!!! http://tweetphoto.com/12334555
29491253,@zzap Oh, I suppose it doesn't.  I just needed a mental image of which version of you I was conversing with.  Which makes no sense.
29491253,Meanwhile, why don't you forget about those cheers in the wirehouse and think about progerse in space?
29491253,Oh my god, so many of these people on the train are sick.... *holds breath*
29491253,@ViciousPotato No?  You sure?  Can I change your mind?
29491253,@zzap Yeah!  I think so!  I just bought the cheap stuff.  Clearly you're a man of taste, and i'm ill prepared! Is your hair curly again yet?
29491253,I have the email address and mailing address of someone who deserves a lot of junk mail.  Any ideas on execution?
29491253,SO MANY people getting on the train!  Argh!  Don't touch me!!!!!
29491253,@wilw All your system memory are belong to us!
29491253,@zzap Tetley's British Blend, is that acceptable?  I have other cookies and biscuits and such things.  Be my guest!
29491253,@zzap Anyway, she's stuck in Aion now, so no coffee for us.  How about some nice tea?  Maybe a shortbread?
29491253,@zzap Haha!!  And if you disagree, would a spirited debate take place?  I used to drink coffee black, but then I became gayer.
29491253,@zzap Haha, so it's all your doing!  You're taunting her!  Lol.  Bad zzap!!  :D  If I ever teach i'll go off on long tangents about zombies.

29491253,@duncn Ah, i'm not a fan of Safari, its ok but not as fun as FF.  Chrome I have no experience with!
29491253,@zzap Under water basket weaving!  What, are you jealous of Mr. Trending Justin?  One day @Odinwednesday will be a trending topic.
29491253,@duncn The world would be a much better place if they did.  Let's get Mozilla tattoos!!!
29491253,@galacticsimian Is it even more homoerotic than Lord of the Flies?!
29491253,@galacticsimian I'm not a fan of Clockwork Orange!  I do need to read Dorian Gray though.  I saw the painting!
29491253,@Aswell lol, that's adorable.  I use it along with Yahoo IM and MSN.  Its just the only one I have access to at work.
29491253,OK, please add me on AIM people.  Its my only link to the outside world from work.  I'm on there as odinoeye ADD ME!

29491253,@_saffron Just wanted to say hello!  :D  But I didn't say hello, did I?  I waved.. hmm.. hello!!!
29491253,@zzap Wow, that's crazy man. Good luck finding it!  But, if you find it I'll have to think of something new to make idle conversation about.
29491253,@zzap So.. did you EVER find that iPod YET?  Is it srsly stuck in the dimension of lost things with my left sock and sense of well being?
29491253,@ViciousPotato You mean you just had the photo taken or you just got the photos back?  Whatsa oh noes for, hmmmm?
29491253,@neilhimself That's a LOT of books, Mr. Gaiman.  A LOT OF BOOKS.
29491253,Everyone keeps telling me how nice I look today.  It's just a tie, people, don't freak out.
29491253,Gee, thanks everyone for your uproarious response in chatting with me on AIM during my time of need...  #sarcasm *scowl*
29491253,@Peppery Well don't leave me hangin'!  Keep me adrift of plans as they arise.  :P excited?

29491253,@WOLF_3D I prefer the longer ones.  Cut or uncut doesn't matter so much.  Wait, what?
29491253,@bfstevie Well they both suck.  As for touching college boys, sounds FUN!
29491253,@OllyNewport I want that camera also!  :( I am legally able to work, and it doesn't help.  Sad.
29491253,@bfstevie Scientology is horrible too.  Bleh.  An that Facebook guy is probably fake.
29491253,@bfstevie Then shouldn't it be "The FAR right wing guy will be able to make you smile."?  Eww... mormons.  Dum dum dum dum dum
29491253,@ViciousPotato Ewwww ...  :x
29491253,@aun_perdido Oh, the D: was in response to your sad face, not the coming out!  Change is good.
29491253,@bfstevie Which after school special is that from?  "The Ginger Wench Who Could Not Smile" or something?
29491253,Wow, Chat Roulette is a waste of time.

29491253,@ViciousPotato Thanks!!  I liked the breakdown at 3:14.  They were pretty into it.
29491253,@ViciousPotato Ooooh.. I love that song... where can I find that?
29491253,@zzap Sounds like you've looked into it more than me.  I submit. :p
29491253,Hmm... I need a college letter of recommendation.  Is anyone out there prestigious and influential?
29491253,@zzap Isn't Shiva a lady?
29491253,@zzap That's sad.  :(  I'm sure it will turn up soon.  It couldn't have gone too far, right?
29491253,@OllyNewport Sometimes at work my cubicle neighbor peeks over and tells me I'm typing too loud.  =\

29491253,@omegatron I'm always on alert for zombie attacks!!
29491253,I wish I could be cool like @WOLF_3D and stare at people on the train/bus. This guy was cute. He was close to age of consent i'm sure...

29491253,@omegatron Wow, that's against the agreement the retailer signs with the credit card company. In the US anyway.  Stand up for your rights!
29491253,@Demo_o Too damn close!  I don't want to talk about it!  AAAAH!  There was alcohol involved!!!
29491253,@monnie That's what I was eyeing, do they only come in blue?  I got Martha Stewarts giant cupcake and cookie books.  :D
29491253,@Demo_o Well, that I would have to scientificly, not sexually.
29491253,RT @zzap: marketwatch says: buy gold and guns.

29491253,@ViciousPotato Woohoo!  Hit those books, mister.
29491253,@Demo_o Absolutely not!!!  No vaginas for me, thanks.
29491253,@ViciousPotato Then you'll do what?  What if he does make you later?  Hmmmm?
29491253,@Demo_o A little bit of everything, just no birthing babies.
29491253,@OllyNewport Everyone is cool and smokes in the future.
29491253,@Demo_o Would you like to be one of my patients?  I'm good at playing doctor.  ;)
29491253,@Demo_o Haha, the doctor told me to take them out!  I am a doctor!
29491253,Now that my stitches are out my wound looks like a gross pus filled crack in my leg.  I don't think they were ready to come out yet.  =/
29491253,I have a day tax return coming.  What should I spend it on, besides the balance owed on my MBP?  Should I spring for a camera?  Clothes?
29491253,@galacticsimian Aww *hug*  There will be more festivities!!!  Viva Italia!
29491253,@bfstevie Hahaha, yes, you told me!  I'm affiliated with no religion.  But I am worshipped in some portions of Scandinavia.
29491253,@Demo_o I foresee myself arguing with the book.  :(  I don't think I'd be able to take it seriously.
29491253,@bfstevie I'm really not a big drinker.  And we're almost out of weed.  It just keeps getting worse!  I need to quit anyway.
29491253,@Karkistoss I don't know how if I can wait that long.  :(  Maybe I just need to get over it.  *le sigh*
29491253,@bfstevie Wrong type of counselor.  I need the "don't hang yourself, dude" type.

29491253,@monnie YAY!!!  What's the first thing you'll do with it??
29491253,@drdrew OK Dr. Drew, don't laugh, but, I smoke too much weed and it's hindering my ambition.  What do I do?  :(
29491253,@bfstevie Yes, sounds like someone needs nude boot camp.  I think I saw that video once...
29491253,@WOLF_3D Here's lookin, at you, kid.

29491253,@bfstevie See, we'd be great parents.  So.. what do we do... grab him from the grocery store or something?
29491253,@bfstevie Oh, just maybe....
29491253,@bfstevie Is it because I'm hat, and would likely attempt to mollest or eat him?  Don't judge!
29491253,@zzap You Dailybooth'd!!!  Horray!  I could use more tubes, myself.
29491253,@WOLF_3D Because Percy Jackson is fucking dripping with sheer sexiness.  Thats why  I went to see it, anyway.

29491253,@bfstevie Can I be Ward?  We can be @WOLF_3D s gay parents!!!
29491253,@WOLF_3D I could eat the popcorn for you.  Or just chew it for you, like feeding a baby bird.
29491253,@bfstevie Salt and pepper can be pretty hot.  Facial hair doesn't work for me.

29491253,@zzap My stomach is in a canopic jar buried deep within a mountain.  My other organs are similarly tucked away.
29491253,@zzap Hey!  My stomach does that sometimes!!!  My stomach gets bored in that jar though.

29491253,I'm ready to go home!  Sleep beckons.
29491253,@ViciousPotato Be more optimistic!  Not that means a whole lot coming from ME...

29491253,@WOLF_3D Mmmm looks like a good time.  Sweet dreams!
29491253,@icanhazxxX I haven't had a donut in way too long.  Maybe I'll pick one up tomorrow on the way to work.  (Strawberry frosted)

29491253,If anyone needs me I'll be dead for the next 9.5 hours.  You know where the shovel is.

29491253,@bfstevie You and your elderly references.  Hmm.. Steve McQueen.. isn't he the 60's George Clooney?
29491253,@WOLF_3D Is it better, faster, stronger than before?

29491253,@WOLF_3D Punch it
29491253,@zzap Well, I know i'm telling the truth, that's all that matters!
29491253,@zzap Well, that's something I'd have to intend to do... And I'd never do that to a friend.
29491253,@zzap And by that I mean deceive.
29491253,Haha, this guy on the train has some pretty terrible highlights in his hair.  Looks like he has spots.
29491253,@ViciousPotato DO IT!  I don't even know what it is, but if it's what you've been Tweeting about trying to do for days, just do it!
29491253,I woke up to pee and I have 5 hours left to sleep when I finish!  Yay!  Also, leg not hurting at all.  Probably from the vicodin.

29491253,Sometimes my face is frozen into a frown.
29491253,@GWCChuck Mexican themed carry in dinner at work.. Mmmm.. Always a good thing.  Makes being an office drone tolerable.
29491253,I can be quite emo sometimes... So why don't I have cool hair?
29491253,Why does my big toe hurt when I wear these boots?  They fit and my toe is fine... Hmmm.
29491253,@bfstevie Hell, that menu sounds good to me.  EVERYONE loves fried chicken!  How is that racist?
29491253,@bfstevie Hmm... that's deep, man.
29491253,@zzap Love that weather

29491253,Why are all of these stores open?
29491253,@monnie The elderly... If the heat doesn't kill them, I WILL!
29491253,@bfstevie You can do it! Brief! Brief! Brief! You're good enough, you're smart enough, and gosh darn it, people like you! #dailyaffirmation
29491253,@zzap And what?  They ask you if you need help and craziness ensues?  Do you flip out when they don't have Kafka?  Whassup, mister?
29491253,@zzap What are you arguing with these librarians about?!!
29491253,@monnie Did you get me an unagi roll?  :D
29491253,Wow, looks like I simply can't log into facebook.  I know my email and password dammit what's YOUR problem?!
29491253,@zzap That's good to hear.  Which reminds me, do you have a zombie survival plan?  If not I can work you into mine.
29491253,@zzap How's stuff?  Still a zombie?

29491253,Getting a mere 7 hours of sleep tonight.  Sad.  :(
29491253,@zzap OK then it's settled.  I'll get my baseball bat, you go find a good book.   It doesn't need to be too long.
29491253,@zzap You could just go read a book while I do.  Or maybe I want you to try to stop me a little.
29491253,@zzap UGH.... NON-aggression?!?!?  How disappointing.  :(  May I do it for you?
29491253,@zzap Gauge out her eyes so she/he can't read.  Also cut off the ears so she/he can't listen to audiobooks.
29491253,@zzap Gross!  Did it taste like chalk?
29491253,So damn busy today!  Argh!!
29491253,My favorite genre of music is movie soundtracks, does that count?  i'm really liking the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack.
29491253,Recent wave of public train violence in Chicago.  I've been sitting in the front car by the driver.  Still don't feel safe.  Need a sword.

29491253,@monnie Yeah, I know, right?  They always ask me to translate, I'm like "IT'S ENGLISH!"
29491253,I hate watching British films with other people who can't understand their accents.
29491253,@monnie Wait, so that nonsense Tweet was a cat?!  Lol
29491253,@nannydeb it'll always be in the last place you look!

29491253,@TheRealPlague You could sell deep fried Plague on a stick.   I foresee it being a big hit at TX state fairs.
29491253,@WOLF_3D Oooh, I love spiders!!!  Especially ones that bite.
29491253,@GWCChuck Wow, I never made the connection.  If the iPad OS looked like a TNG datapad I would be a lot more excited about it.

29491253,@Peppery Haha, you're awfully excited about the iPad!
29491253,RT @OllyNewport: Explosion at a pie factory in Huddersfield.  3.14159265 dead.
29491253,@omegatron Ouch.  Those are terrible.  Especially early in the morning.  :(
29491253,@OllyNewport That's more than a nap!  That's like epic cat-like slumber.
29491253,So I "hid" my ex-boyfriends status updates on Facebook.  It's quite liberating, like ignoring his texts!
29491253,I need to write something.  :(
29491253,@bfstevie Noooooooo!!!!!!!!
29491253,@neilhimself *hugs*  I'd be such a wreck if I were in your shoes.  It will get easier, but don't ever forget her.
29491253,I actually searched all over downtown Chicago for a cinnamon roll and ended up getting one at the bakery in my office building.  =/
29491253,Breakfast.... Cinnamon roll, maybe this hunk of lemon pound cake if i'm still hungry after, if not, I eat it later.
29491253,Awake too goddamn early.  Not happy.  Breakfast will not cure this foul mood,
29491253,Make that 4.5 hours of sleep.  I'll be a zombie... Will need breakfast..   ;_;
29491253,@ViciousPotato At least 60.
29491253,Will I be able to function on five hours of sleep tomorrow?

29491253,@KuinSan Get where?!  :)
29491253,Also, I need a new Twitter profile pic.  Should I just take a different photo of the cat, or something entirely different?
29491253,All the free music out there, and here I am buying songs from iTunes. Even pirates enjoy convenience now and then, we'll even pay for it.
29491253,The King & his men stole the Queen from her bed, and bound her in her bones,? the seas be ours and by the powers, where we will, we'll roam.

29491253,Morning... cup of tea, anyone?
29491253,Off to the train station.
29491253,@zzap So does this mean you'll be a zombie again today?
29491253,@zzap Sorry to hear that.  :(  Nap later?
29491253,I'm debating linking my Twitter and Dailybooth.  Do you REALLY need to see me AND be privy to my genius?
29491253,@nannydeb Aww... I need to do some ironing too.  No ironing board, though.  I suppose that's not an excuse.  *sigh*
29491253,@monnie Nuthin' much, you?
29491253,@ScootMcGoof Sounds like grandpa is ready for the loony bin.
29491253,I miss @galacticsimian  :(

29491253,@milkkore Thanks for the link!  I tried to DM you back, but you're not following me!  :(
29491253,@milkkore What's that from?

29491253,@galacticsimian Luck!
29491253,I've only been setting up an hour earlier than usual the last two weeks.. but damn, it's rough.

29491253,@Peppery Again?  Beware of pirates!  <3
29491253,@bfstevie Also funny, I'm looking at a prospective university in CT which happens to be a Catholic school. Mmm... Catholic college freshmen.
29491253,@bfstevie Hells no!!!!  I have my own religion, based around ME!  That's funny you say that, I'm watching Religulous.
29491253,@bfstevie That doesn't even begin to describe my ire!
29491253,Wow, what do I say/do to the stranger who just walked into my house?  Oh you were invited by asshole 3rd roommate?  Wanna knock?
29491253,They call me the seeker.
29491253,Wow, my roommate got a handcrafted replica of the lament configuration (Google it).  It's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.
29491253,@ViciousPotato That IS awesome!  Have fun!
29491253,I've lost interest in SG-1.  I need a new show to watch on DVD.  Honestly, 10 seasons of SG-1 was just not in my future.

29491253,Lots of ugly people out and about today.

29491253,I need to move to a place that is not a big city, nor within a big city's blast radius.

29491253,@OllyNewport Do you drink hot chocolate when it's warm outside too?
29491253,Well, another empty bottle of Grey Goose to add to the collection.
29491253,Is iMovie really meant to be a legitimate video editing software? Is it just me or is it way too basic? Is there a hidden menu I don't know?
29491253,@WOLF_3D Wow, is that true?  Source?
29491253,Well, I guess Avatar was good.
29491253,This will be my first 3D film ever.  I'm excited.  It starts in 10 minutes!!!

21282873,@bamagirl2319 I'm not familar with Conyers just that it's above Covington lol.Thanks for the info.
21282873,@ashleighjoelle Sorry just now replying but I think they said his dad died.
21282873,@ashleighjoelle I think it's because he no longer has daddy to hide behind.
21282873,@Chico6  You may be able to ask management if you could move to another apartment in the building.
21282873,@TeamKiowa I'll try it when I get home. I'm at work now and we use IE here plus I don't think they'd like that on the work computer. LOL
21282873,@TeamKiowa so what do these show up at the top of your browser instead of just a grey screen?
21282873,@Watch_LUX. I've actually have met her. I lived in LA when they were filming Roswell's 3rd season and met most of the cast.
21282873,@Massena1 I'll have to look for it on the web.

21282873,@Black_Pack Well, I wasn't originally going to Dragon Con,but if I can swing it I am. I only live an hour away from downtown Atlanta.
21282873,@Black_Pack Alex and Chaske were added to the Atlanta Dragon Con guest list.

21282873,This Cold Case episode is making me want to watch Carnivàle.
21282873,@Lyndaleblanc I do remember you. I'm doing good except for a chronic ear infection. How are you doing? Congratulations on your grandson!
21282873,@Black_Pack Yes it sounds like it's going to be an action pack film. Isn't this the one that supposed to be similar to Taken?
21282873,Onlu been up for about an hour. I'm now at Shoney's for lunch/ dinner. Would that be a dinch or lunner since breakfeast/lunch is brunch?
21282873,My ear is bothering me again. Grrrrr..
21282873,@TwilightLexicon I was wondering the exact same thing.
21282873,@KiGordonOnline No, they refunded my money. I thought they would just do Kiowa since it just said him on the site at first.
21282873,Ask me anything http://formspring.me/GroundedSouls
21282873,@KiGordonOnline Yeah I'm not going to get to do the meet and greet because of it. Which kind of sucks.
21282873,@prichila He's probably dead to the world. I know I would be if I stayed up that long. lol
21282873,@Black_Pack  Atlanta is in two weeks! I'm excited that Tinsel was added, but sad that Bronson can't be there though.
21282873,@tvdnews That freakishly looks like Ian in doll form. Who ever made it did a good job. LOL
21282873,I'm at work. I was supposed to have been off, but next Saturday I'm going to see Muse in concert, so I switched.
21282873,@Black_Pack Got my shirt I ordered  today. Yay!

21282873,They had scheduled the appointment for 9am and I thought hell no, so I called and got it rescheduled to 3pm. I work that night.
21282873,I got an appointment with the Ear Nose and Throat doctor on the 8th. I hope they can get this cleared up.

21282873,I'm debating on taking the first week of March off. I only work 1 day that week because I'm done taking 1 vacation day on the 4th.
21282873,@prichila It's getting a little warmer this week by Sunday they said we should be near 60.
21282873,@prichila I remember when I had lunch with Kat she said that he made her take vitamins too.

21282873,I got a doctors apointment in the morning at 11 and then I have to work tomorrow night. I hope I can gt a nap in before work.
21282873,@BPOX LOL that's cute.
21282873,@jacobjunior7 Probably is well at least it's colder here in Georgia than in Vancouver.
21282873,@ninadobrev I didn't know they had ketchup flavored lays. I usually just dip mine in ketchup but that makes it easier.
21282873,@DefineDelicate Okay thanks.
21282873,She's now hiding under the table.
21282873,Chloe tried to jump on the half wall like she normally does but she missed stepped and landed on the end table knocking down some frames.
21282873,@DefineDelicate I knew that.
21282873,LOL nothing which is why I'm bored.
21282873,@VampireDlovers Hey what's up?
21282873,@PaulWesleyFanz How long are you going to be there? I wasn't feeling well today but if you are still there Friday I'd like to meet you.
21282873,@Black_Pack Cool so I should have it in time for the Atlanta tour stop.
21282873,@Black_Pack yeah I ordered my shirt last night.
21282873,Feeling blah I hope after I get something to eat I might feel better. I sort of want to go back to bed.
21282873,I hate my sinuses.
21282873,@KaterinaGraham Welcome back to Georgia!
21282873,@juliebenz She sort of reminds me of a dog I had growing up. He had specks on his nose like her so we called him  Speckles.
21282873,Watching Stepfather and listening to the sound of my cat snoring.
21282873,@wolfgrl00 I've been to creations cons before so I know what they are like.

21282873,@prichila Yeah that was one of my favortie parts of the episode where Grams told Damon off.
21282873,@KiGordonOnline I bought a ticket, but I don't know if I can afford to go had some extra expenses.
21282873,I wanted to go to the movies tomorrow, but it doesn't look like I'm going with the way the weather looks.
21282873,@MrsdogC Your hubby is awesome. I love the design of that ring.
21282873,@teamkatgraham me too!
21282873,@KaterinaGraham congrats on reaching 20,000!
21282873,@llAsHLeYll I wonder what would happen if the first person they met was already married.
21282873,@BPOX  I might of read it wrong.
21282873,LMAO at the Simpsons "We are now releasing the Canadian dove the beaver!"
21282873,AMC picked it up evidently.RT @BPOX @GroundedSouls #TheWalkingDead is a comic by Robert Kirkman who is a completely awesome.
21282873,We are now supposed to get another 2 to 4 inches tonight and in the morning. Looks like more overtime and a ride in the hummer.
21282873,@DefineDelicate Well they will be filming in Atlanta. I don't know where in Atlanta thought but it's a possibility I guess.
21282873,We are supposed to get another inch of snow tonight. Not a lot but I just want to get home from work with out having to work over.
21282873,@Chico6 Happy Birthday!
21282873,They are going to start filming a tv show in May called The Walking Dead. After the Vampires leave for the summer we are getting Zombies.
21282873,Happy Valentine's Day to everyone.

21282873,@BrannanLouise You're young still give it time.
21282873,@wolfgrl00 I am. I'm working night shift so I'll be up awhile.
21282873,@wolfgrl00 Is that something they offer at the con and not online?
21282873,@ashleighjoelle Well I'm gessing the Damon/Elena people want them too.
21282873,@wolfgrl00 Just ask them for a hug. That's what I've done in the past.
21282873,I can't believe that Stelena is on tv guides top tv couples that people want them to break up. Go Team Stelena!  #VampireDiaries
21282873,@wolfgrl00 It is my dad makes it with deer meat. Can't really tell the difference, but he makes the best chili in my opinion.
21282873,@Black_Pack Now will this be on the day of the movie opening?
21282873,Eating dinner which is homemade chili.
21282873,@KiGordonOnline A twitter friend of mine @kayliebrooke friend went to school with  Kiowa. Here's a yearbook pic http://twitpic.com/13401a

21282873,@Black_Pack I might be able to go to Memphis in June it's a six hour drive but I've never been and it's a city I've wanted to visit.
21282873,Just been at work for an hour and I'm already tired. I slept pretty good this afternoon and didn't want to wake up I think that's why.
21282873,Finally got home the shift sergeant drove me home in a humvee (not sure if spelling is correct).
21282873,*Sigh* I may not be going home any time soon.
21282873,I tell you the DOT is failing on it's job around here. Last time they salted around the station. This time nothing.
21282873,@wolfgrl00 Awww that sucks. I know I've had that problem before. I hope tomorrow  there's more light.
21282873,@wolfgrl00 Hey I hope you are having a great time there.
21282873,They said the roads are really bad lol I just hope I don't bust my butt getting out to the car.

21282873,@IHeartVDiaries Stelena!
21282873,@TVDGaGirls I'm afraid to drive my car too much longer the way the breaks sound. They fixed my mom's front brakes for 70 bucks.

21282873,I'm getting my brakes fixed in the morning. I love that my 2nd cousins own a garage. I can get stuff done pretty cheap.

21282873,@excelaunt Fan art? No, but I may work on some today. Any season particular you'd like to see?
21282873,@excelaunt  I couldn't remember it's been awhile since I've seen season 5.
21282873,I'm so not up this early unless I'm at a convention on vacation. I hope Chloe doesn't give me any trouble with getting her in the carrier.
21282873,@excelaunt And wasn't she nearly blamed for a death during recruit when she was binge drinking?
21282873,@excelaunt @ginnytwin There's a difference between drinking and getting drunk. Like I've drinked occasionally but I've never been drunk.
21282873,It's February 11 here so Happy Birthday Taylor Lautner.  #HappyBirthdayTaylor
21282873,@llAsHLeYll Hey are you going to the twi-tour's Atlanta stop? I know you mentioned you were thinking about it.
21282873,@excelaunt Yep she was drunk off her ass at Chloe's engagement party.
21282873,@IHeartVDiaries Awww that's awesome that you have a caring boss.
21282873,@AprilMWalsh I know I hate when people tend to group a few fans in with whole  lot of fans. Each group has some bad apples.
21282873,@AprilMWalsh So true that's why I'm not in it that much anymore. I love my    #VampireDiaries fandom at least we can agree to disagree.
21282873,@THEREALCHASKE  You need to come to the Atlanta tour stop at least you won't have to deal with the snow.
21282873,@kayliebrooke Great show Kaylie.
21282873,@KiGordonOnline I remember when I was little and it would snow my grandma would make snow cream.
21282873,@LeyLey5991 Yes @KaterinaGraham is the real one I've seen her twitter in person so I can vouch for her.
21282873,Man that wind is cold!
21282873,Sure Rex blame Skylar from ripping your family apart when you are the one who slept with Stacie in the first place.
21282873,@Taytay_daily I'm predicting he will be a trending topic.
21282873,@DefineDelicate Not sure but it's a day I'm off lol.
21282873,@teamkatgraham I hope you feel better soon so you can get to sleep.
21282873,@DefineDelicate I'm going to try to get down there soon. I was thinking about Thursday. If  you hear anything let me know.
21282873,@iansomerhalder That's why you invest in earplugs you can still hear things like the alarm and cats.

21282873,It was called Smallville because it was about Clark Kent before he became Superman technically that shouldn't involve Lois.
21282873,You know people keeping saying it's called Smallville for a reason yes it is but the reason has nothing to do with Lois Lane.continued..
21282873,@llAsHLeYll I'm way ahead of you i got 4 copies ordered lol.

21282873,@MelBee85 well I guess they've seen the spy shows where a book is hollowed out and gets some device in it.
21282873,@MelBee85 Well I guess if you have a kindle then your home free.

21282873,@ninadobrev At least ya'll are in doors to day. LOL it would be a good day if the script called for a snowy winter scene.
21282873,It's snowing! Getting from my car to the garage is going to be a bitch. I hope I don't fall. I will be glad when my side is clean.
21282873,What was bad about it was that I had to call my mom at work to call my dad. I didn't have my cell phone, so I didn't remember my dad's cell.
21282873,So I locked my keys in the car but luckily I was only a few minutes away from the house.

15470602,@thecYnsue yes - now get in the kitchen and bake me a pie!!!
15470602,@CliffMarkman wow!  Not going to induce?  Try watching a funny movie or maybe drive down a really bumpy road :)
15470602,And now reality sets back in...  Grrrrrr.  I hate Mondays X(
15470602,Thank you Pandora!  You played Journey - Don't Stop believing just when I needed to be done for the day.  Good night Cleveland!!!

15470602,Up and marginally at 'em!  woo-hoo weekend!  =D
15470602,Came to the realization that being sick is a transcendental journey through being Snow Whites dwarves: sleepy, dopey, grumpy, sneezy so far.
15470602,@nwhale whhhheeeeeeeeee!!!  Mac book loaded with win7 FTW!!!
15470602,@lwilli63 yeah yeah - rub it in :/
15470602,Super hot steam shower and musinex ftw!  Begone slug-hive incubating in my face!
15470602,@thatDJSpider gratz!  Wish I could say I was in the same spot with my cc debt :(  I'm waiting for 12/21/2012 to erase my debt :/
15470602,@lwilli63 between the ta-tas!
15470602,helped @lwilli63 pick out her new tattoo - check it!  http://tweetphoto.com/13147256

15470602,wow WOW and SUPER WOW!  new video by OK-GO http://bit.ly/d6mo8H
15470602,@petzilla hah!  I should really start watching that then.  Sounds like me and mine could be xtras in it!
15470602,@froggysammy actually super tasty!  its a milk chocolate with tiny crumbles of bakon melted in.  The sweet/salty taste is great!
15470602,@froggysammy I've had the chocolate bar - nummy!
15470602,@petzilla hah!  that is now my xbox avatar's quote!
15470602,@petzilla damn you for not living in the aug!  We are a commune of professional computer nerds and could have you fixed pronto!  :)
15470602,Attention GA state employees  =( RT @AUG_Chronicle: Senate leader: 'There will be massive layoffs' http://bit.ly/d3D8hN http://bit.ly/9hIUfe
15470602,I think it's a good time to hone my knife fighting skillz. Gotta prepare for the apocalypse and any gamer knows you run faster with a knife.
15470602,@lwilli63 if I have to you have to too!
15470602,@froggysammy I'm guessing you meant 'got' and not 'hot'?  If so - gratz!  :). If you meant 'hot' I have no idea what you are saying ;)
15470602,@Grady_Monster I sure we can something to do with the bacon awesomeness :). Actually quite psyched about trying a bacon bloody mary!
15470602,That and I feel like I'm extra musky, like I've been doing shooters of badger and moose urine :/
15470602,My body is breaking out like it's finally hitting puberty and catching up with my throat-beard.  Damn you excessive stress and bad diet!
15470602,@thecYnsue @lwilli63 just picked one up yesterday, so she has the inside scoop as to how it compares to an ipod touch...
15470602,@petzilla its actually switching run levels to an admin mode.  Longer than 5secs and I would think maybe ram/caching/disk thrashing as prob
15470602,@petzilla how long of a delay.  On vista I've seen up to 5 seconds normally.  Win 7 is faster at switching through it, + UAC less invasive
15470602,@RachaelLeighona did your mom stab a bitch?
15470602,@cry_havoc sweet bacon pops!  Buy me all of them!!!
15470602,@petzilla that's usual behavior.  Everything but the UAC prompt is visually suppressed.  You can turn off UAC, but its actually a good thing
15470602,@RachaelLeighona it's gotta be the snails... :(
15470602,@pauledwardmarsh @triskyl Gravity was mostly to blame for my stumble this morning. That and I'm not truck/cowboy material as @thecYnsue said
15470602,@lwilli63 @pauledwardmarsh so has her throat...  She's a dirty dirty girl :D
15470602,@nwhale Suck it, Trebek!  You wish you had my 1337 light skillz, or 0226 skillz :)
15470602,@djcodec Hey - bring your Sis' mini 1000 and we can hackintosh it tonight.  I've got my USB key rigged for a custom mini 1000 installer
15470602,@thecYnsue See, what had happened wuz...
15470602,Just stellar...  Fell out of the truck and effed up my ankle this morning.  So glad I have a 1/4 mile walk in from the parking lot :/
15470602,@thatDJSpider I agree - I would say go both cookie tubes for 100% of your daily nomz =D
15470602,@lowprofilepaul yeah...  What I'm afraid of :/  hey - you ready for friday?  It should be an exciting evening one way or another...
15470602,@cry_havoc @lwilli63 I will be good-ish this weekend.  I'm gonna try to drink for free if possible!  :)
15470602,so my director singled me out in our meeting as having the same sense of humor he has...  this won't be good for peer relations =(
15470602,@thecYnsue @cry_havoc I would have used the word "retardnocity"
15470602,@lowprofilepaul His apology is probably something like "I'm sorry for the 15 ho's you know about..."
15470602,Yay for uncomfortable elevator rides :/  loud angry patients and the employees desperately trying to avoid that elevator
15470602,@nwhale @Grady_Monster roger that ghost rider.  I'll be starting my decent shortly and should be on final approach by 6 pm local time.

15470602,Quote of the day: "There's something sexy about a half-naked chick coming at you with a knife". :)
15470602,@cry_havoc if the guy is dead that is probably enough to get him out of jury duty in and of itself.  At least one would hope so :/
15470602,@cry_havoc I like my PoW "Fart Loading 98% Complete" shirt though :'(
15470602,@marirene but like zero-tolerance policies, people don't seem to know when it is and is not appropriate :(  And this is why daddy drinks!
15470602,@marirene I believe the idea is organized terror conspiracies.  Otherwise every tragedy can be defined as terror (oh wait, they usually are)

15470602,@cry_havoc they most likely will :(  marsh and I were saying maybe the loft?  no alcohol at the hookah bar allowed (even though they sell)

15470602,@Dr_Minou oomph!  sorry to hear that :(  at least you have the good drugs now =D
15470602,@Triskyl apparently they explain that after several hundred severe testicle injuries, he no longer registers pain at 100%

15470602,Swapped my customary energy drink for a home made smoothie a-la Alton Brown.  We'll see how it fares :)
15470602,Almost didn't make it in to work today due to the threat of an inch of snow this afternoon.  I mean, they did close the schools already :/

15470602,@lwilli63 I'm guessing he moved on since they hated him in whatchacallit town beauton?
15470602,@dhortens WTF!  lit it on fire?  Was that before you smashed it after your rocking renditio nof "Tiny Bubbles"?

15470602,@Queen_April @petzilla Ultimately it comes down to beer vs. wine though...
15470602,@petzilla @Queen_April However, from one who hates airports but loves flying, German efficiency may make Munich a better connector
15470602,@Queen_April Only been to Heathrow, and as a destination, not a connector.  As usual, I am a useless meat-sack =D
15470602,@Queen_April Let me go on your behalf?  =D
15470602,@Triskyl yeah - he's good for the time being.  He should heal up from this just fine :)
15470602,OK - just discovered the "skants" meme on Regretsy.  I am now both fascinated and scarred for life (or at least for 20 minutes)

15470602,@RachaelLeighona @JuSt better that than *type*squish*type*squish*...
15470602,@roryrezzelle anytime?  How about November?  Verizon will pencil that in for you :)
15470602,Had to be something bigish like a raccoon or another dog.  I was planning on this potentially being a one-way trip to the vet.  Glad its not
15470602,Hoorayz!!!  The dog only has a festering crazy-deep flesh wound!  The vet doesn't this is cancer related.  Thinks he was bitten.
15470602,Kicking myself for not taking out pet insurance in november when I had the chance...  I was all "whatever - who needs that?".  Yeah... :/
15470602,@petzilla I wasn't a project manager until a few weeks ago, and now I'm ready to strangle my incompetent director!  :/
15470602,@petzilla Hah!  That's extra funny because it's alarmingly accurate.
15470602,OMFingG!  I think my director has a degree in dead horse beating.  I'm going to call PETA right now and see if they will harpoon him!
15470602,@Triskyl thanks for the love :)
15470602,@thecYnsue @cry_havoc There is a high likelyhood that Samson will need to be put down very soon, maybe this afternoon...

15470602,HOLY CRAP!  It's already 4:30!  How time flies when you're wishing you were drinking hemlock and watching re-runs of Max-Headroom!
15470602,@nwhale ow!  ow!  my arm!  I need to work out.  You buy and I'm in...
15470602,@cry_havoc Good thing I'm switching to a diet of only energy-drinks (healthy by nature) and alcohol (known for it's promotion of healt)
15470602,@nwhale really?  you don't like it?  It's Asus heavy - you should have a Asus-on!
15470602,@pauledwardmarsh Damn my on-callness and it's interference with internal liquification!  I shall be there though!
15470602,Going home for leftover brats and kraut.  Last time I did this I ended up with saurkrotch.  Hopefully I won't be so butterfingered this time
15470602,@cry_havoc I'm in a meeting with my new Director right now, so it's borderline Hell right now :/
15470602,@cry_havoc Meh - it could be worse.  But it could be better too :D

15470602,Feel like I'm in a calm before a storm.  Not a good feeling at all :(
15470602,Would you rather face a rabid badger, or a Monday morning?  Me, I'm really not sure.  I always have a chance of killing the badger :/

15470602,@Triskyl @pauledwardmarsh I will be going downtown after work anyway to do some store-front research it looks like :)
15470602,@Triskyl I am definitely feeling it today...  how about a DT location?  Maybe the loft?  It's quiet/comfortable and not family friendly :)

15470602,@Grady_Monster that doesn't sound good.  Bad day?  Groundhog Days can be like that.  They get better after a few hundred repetitions :/
15470602,I just watched my little dog pee on his front paws :P  At least he won't get athletes foot...
15470602,@dhortens @lwilli63 today is groundhog day.  Maybe we can wake up and do it all again tomorrow like bill murray...
15470602,@dhortens and that's why God invented killer asteroids and mass extinction events.  *looks forward to 2012*

15470602,Wow - is it illegal to strangle someone to death if they are already brain-dead?  I think I have legal grounds at this point :/
15470602,@CliffMarkman The band name would have been "Lucid Tiger", Russ would have a bandanna'd  mike stand and Rob would wear suspendered shorts.

15470602,@turborabbit and the crapper/waiting rooms
15470602,@turborabbit play with a netbook with ssd instead of hdd.  4 second boots and if you suspend or hibernate even faster.  iPxxx are all flash
15470602,@turborabbit current netbooks yes, i agree.  with the new atom chips coming out and nvidia prepping their ion2 chipset that will change
15470602,@turborabbit I think ion2 powered netbook/tablets w/ multitouch screen on win7 will be better than iPad. iPhone OS is too restrictive.
15470602,@mattjohnson80 no java and no flash - and that black bezel around the edge is HUGE and ugly!  Hello lcd from 2005 :/
15470602,Time for a vacation soon, I think :(  Januarys are terrible months...

15470602,@lwilli63 pulp fiction is his best role...  Hands down!
15470602,@lwilli63 omg - yes he is!  thats one of those movies that pissed me off so much i dont wanna watch it again.

15333450,@MikeOTheAirport I can't do the carbomb! lol It tastes like paint to me! ...and if I started drinking that early I'd be asleep by ten
15333450,Well not counting nights ending after 8 a.m.
15333450,I made Sangria to go with dinner. I had to give it the taste test. Probably the first time I've consumed alcohol at 8 a.m.
15333450,This the best Holiday. Why don't we spend more time in a year telling people we're thankful their in our lives?

15333450,...Well just their music. I don't have an opinion of them personally. Except they seem to enjoy repetitive and annoying music.
15333450,Not only is it still the dumbest song I've ever heard, it's now lodged into my brain. I detest the Black Eyed Peas!
15333450,I was distracted and didn't change the station when "I've Got aFeeling" came on the radio and I listened to the entire song.
